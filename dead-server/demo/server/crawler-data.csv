Schultz offers to help him if he chooses to stay with him and be his partner. Eventually they learn that she was sold to a plantation in Mississippi.

He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen is not easily fooled.</p>\n                        <div class=""author-container"">\n                            <em>&mdash;<a href=""/search/title?plot_author=Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_2"">Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</a></em>\n                        </div>\n                </li>\n                <li class=""ipl-zebra-list__item"" id=""summary-ps2809241"">\n                    <p>In the late 1850&#39;s, former dentist turned bounty hunter Dr King Schultz buys the freedom of a man named Django from a slave trader duo in a quest to find and kill some men he wants dead. Afterwards, Django sets out with help from Schultz to find and rescue his wife Broomhilda who like him was sold into slavery by an anonymous owner. Their journey takes them to a plantation called Candieland, owned by a ruthless tycoon.

In the midst of his search, Dr. Schultz crosses paths with Django (Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx), a freed slave and skilled tracker who seeks to rescue his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie (Academy Award-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio). Once Django has aided Dr. Schultz in coral ling the Brittle brothers, the two team up to capture some of the most wanted men in the South. Meanwhile, Django never loses sight of his mission to free Broomhilda from the treacherous slave trade before it&#39;s too late. Upon arriving at Candie&#39;s nefarious plantation, dubbed Candyland, Django and Dr. Schultz discover that slaves are being groomed for gladiator-like competitions by Candie&#39;s malevolent right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), and together they skillfully work their way onto the compound for a closer look. But just as Django and his partner locate Broomhilda and plot a daring escape, Candie&#39;s house slave Stephen (Academy Award-nominee Samuel L. Jackson) catches wind of their plan, and informs his master of the betrayal. Now, as a clandestine organization attempts to back them into a corner, Django and Dr. Schultz will have to come out with pistols blazing if they ever hope to free Broomhilda from Candyland and the clutches of its vile proprietor.</p>\n                        <div class=""author-container"">\n                            <em>&mdash;<a href=""/search/title?plot_author=ahmetkozan&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_4"">ahmetkozan</a></em>\n                        </div>\n                </li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","('<ul class=""ipl-zebra-list"" id=""plot-synopsis-content"">\n            <li class=""ipl-zebra-list__item"" id=""synopsis-py3253641"">In 1858, Django (<a href=""/name/nm0004937/"">Jamie Foxx</a>), a slave, is chained to a bunch of other slaves and being marched to his new owner&#39;s estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (<a href=""/name/nm0910607/"">Christoph Waltz</a>).<br/><br/>Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky&#39;s horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky&#39;s leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck&#39;s horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.<br/><br/>Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee. As Django and Schultz ride off, we hear Speck pleading for his life. We hear a gunshot and can see blood splatter as Dicky&#39;s brains are blown out.<br/><br/>Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso. As they travel through the streets, townspeople stop to stare in disbelief at the sight of a black man on a horse, much to Schultz&#39;s confusion. As Schultz ties his cart down at a hitching post, he checks some papers to make sure he&#39;s in the right place. The two then walk into a saloon despite the fact that Django is forbidden from doing so because of the South&#39;s segregation laws. When Schultz insists on being served, the barkeep runs out of the saloon, Schultz calling after him to specifically bring the sheriff, not the town marshal.<br/><br/>While they wait, Schultz pours beers for himself and Django and leaves money on the bar. He explains that he is no longer a dentist, but a bounty hunter in search of the Brittle brothers who are wanted dead or alive. He admits that although he knows the general location of the brothers, near Gatlinburg, they have adopted aliases, and he needs somebody who can identify them. Schultz tells Django that if he helps him bring in the Brittle brothers, Schultz will give him his freedom, pay him a $75 share of the reward, and let him keep his horse. Django immediately agrees, when, as if on cue, Schultz sees the sheriff coming down the sidewalk.<br/><br/>The sheriff enters the saloon, shotgun in hand, and tells Schultz and Django to leave. The two comply, and exit out the swinging doors. We see that a number of townspeople are watching the spectacle unfolding as the sheriff asks them why they are coming into his town and showing themselves with the sole purpose of causing trouble. Schultz is silent, then steps forward. A spring-mounted Derringer pops up in his right hand, and he shoots the sheriff in the stomach. The townspeople are stunned as the sheriff stumbles to the ground, moaning in pain from the bullet wound. Schultz walks around the wounded sheriff, aims his Derringer, and shoots him in the head, killing him. The townspeople immediately run for their lives. Schultz looks up and tells the bartender that now is the time to fetch the marshal. The bartender runs off while Schultz and Django go back into the saloon to wait.<br/><br/>The town marshal and most of the town arrive and train rifles on the front door of the saloon. Schultz hears that he has 100 rifles aimed at his head, and gets the marshal to agree to not have him shot dead like a dog in the street when he comes out. Schultz then exits, hands raised over his head, and a paper in his hand. He announces to the marshal and to the assembled townsfolk what has really happened: that the dead man the people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of &#39;Bill Sharpe&#39;, is a wanted cattle rustler named Willard Peck, with a $200 bounty on his head. Schultz says that the paper in his hand is an official document from a judge that charges King with finding and bringing Peck back to the proper jurisdiction dead or alive. Schultz then suggests that the marshal pay him the $200 fee.<br/><br/>Later, while camping, Django admits to Schultz that what he wants to do once he is liberated is buy freedom for his wife, a slave girl named Broomhilda von Shaft (<a href=""/name/nm0913488/"">Kerry Washington</a>) who had been a servant of a German mistress before being sold into slavery in the U.S. Their owner Carrucan (<a href=""/name/nm0001136/"">Bruce Dern</a>) was cruel and disapproved of their marriage, so the pair attempted escape. They were caught by the Brittle brothers, who tortured and branded them both with the mark of a runaway, a small &quot;R&quot; on their right cheeks. Carrucan then directed the Brittle brothers to sell the pair to separate owners, and to take the lowest price for Django.<br/><br/>Django and Schultz eventually develop a plan to infiltrate an estate near Gatlinburg where they suspect that the Brittle brothers reside and for Django to identify them. Django is to play-act as a freed slave who has been hired as Schultz&#39;s valet. They arrive at the plantation owned by Spencer &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Bennett (<a href=""/name/nm0000467/"">Don Johnson</a>). Schultz states he is looking to buy one of Bennett&#39;s slave girls for an exorbitant price. As he and Bennett talk business, Django is given free range to look around the estate.<br/><br/>Django asks Betina, his escort, if she knows of the Brittles. Betina admits that she doesn&#39;t know them, leading Django to suspect that the Brittles are using a false name. At this, Betina reveals that three overseer brothers known as the Schaeffers did arrive in the past year. She points out the first one in the field. Django looks through his telescope and sees that it is Ellis. Seeing Ellis causes Django to have a lengthy flashback over running away with Broomhilda and pleading with Big John to spare Broomhilda from the whip, unsuccessfully. The flashback ends with Big John saying, &quot;I like the way you beg, boy.&quot;<br/><br/>Snapping out of his flashback, Django learns that Big John and Little Raj are on a different part of the plantation, about to whip a young slave girl for breaking eggs. The two have tied her to a tree by the arms and Big John is about to use the whip on her when Django appears and shouts Big John&#39;s name. Big John turns, stunned to see Django, who suddenly produces a Derringer similar to Schultz&#39;s and shoots him through a Bible page glued to his shirt. He looks down at his bullet wound, stunned, as Django tells him, &quot;I like the way you die, boy,&quot; and Big John pitches forward, dead. Little Raj attempts to grab his revolver, but Django grabs Big John&#39;s whip and uses it to beat him unconscious. He then takes the gun and unloads it into Little Raj, just as Schultz comes racing in. Django tells Schultz that Ellis is already galloping away across the cotton field. Schultz tracks Ellis through his sniper rifle, and once Django says he is sure he is right, Schultz fires. Blood sprays the cotton flowers as Ellis falls off his horse, a bullet in his chest. Though Bennett is incensed when he arrives, he is forced to let them go once Schultz explains they are legally authorized to kill and collect these men.<br/><br/>That night, out for revenge, Bennett calls out all the fellow white men of the plantation to kill Django and Schultz, spotting their dentist&#39;s cart camped outside of town. The men make their charge over the hill in KKK style masks, and surround the small campsite. The scene then changes to earlier, when Bennett is giving instructions to the other Klansmen to not shoot Django or Schultz unless they are shot at. He puts his bag hood on, and a funny scene ensues as Bennett finds he is unable to see through the eye holes in his mask. Everyone else starts to bicker about how badly made their masks are, which ends with Willard, whose wife Jenny spent all afternoon making masks for them, giving up and riding away, furious. Eventually, the Klansmen get their act together.<br/><br/>As they surround the cart, one of the men spots what he thinks is Django and Schultz hiding under the cart. He peeks under, only to find that the &#39;bodies&#39; are actually bedrolls. Bennett wonders where the two bounty hunters actually are. In response, the scene cuts to Django and Schultz hiding in a tree a short distance away, Schultz carrying a rifle. Schultz says, &quot;auf wiedersehen,&quot; and fires at the cart, setting off a bundle of dynamite hidden in the tooth on the roof of his cart. It blows up and kills most of the Klansmen. Bennett manages to survive the detonation and begins riding away. Schultz sees this and hands the rifle over to Django, letting him do the honors. Django tracks, and then fires, hitting Bennett and shooting him off his horse. Schultz realizes that Django is a formidable natural sharpshooter.<br/><br/>King asks what Django will do now that he is officially free, and Django says he will locate his wife (believed to be in Mississippi) and try to purchase her freedom. King, who has bonded with Django and is impressed by both his intelligence and marksmanship, proposes to help Django rescue his wife if Django will work with him over the winter in collecting bounties. King is also impressed with Broomhilda&#39;s name (and her ability to speak German), telling Django the German legend of Siegfried and Brunhilde. In the legend, the beautiful Brunhilde is captured and imprisoned in a tower on a mountainside that is guarded by a dragon and surrounded by hellfire. Her lover, Siegfried, rescues her, facing the mountain and dragon simply because he is brave, but also overcoming the hellfire out of his love for Brunhilde. Django is quite taken with the tale.<br/><br/>Django agrees to King&#39;s proposal, finding him to be a deeply honorable man in spite of his line of work. King trains Django to not only be an expert with a gun, but also how to read and present himself in public. On one mission, Django and King perch themselves on a hill overlooking a small farm where Django hesitates to kill a man who is now peacefully working on the farm and has a son. King explains that before the man owned this farm and started a family, he murdered several people while robbing stagecoaches, and that he has a $7,000 bounty on his head. King explains that it is this own man&#39;s actions in a dirty world that has brought the bounty hunters to his door. Hearing this, Django shoots and kills the man in front of his son. King tells him to keep the wanted poster, as a bounty hunter&#39;s first successful poster is good luck. Throughout the winter, Django imagines he and Broomhilda free and happy.<br/><br/>Jumping forward to March 1859, once winter passes, the two head back to the South in search of Broomhilda. King discovers that she was sold to a man named Calvin Candie (<a href=""/name/nm0000138/"">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>), the owner of a plantation known as &#39;Candie Land&#39;. Candie is famous for breeding &quot;mandingos&quot;--slaves who are bred to fight each other to the death (bare-knuckle) for their owner&#39;s amusement (and for betting purposes). King says that he will pose as a wealthy European who seeks to purchase one of Candie&#39;s mandingos to take to fight in Europe, and that Django is his business partner and talent evaluator.<br/><br/>That evening, Django and King arrive at a Candie&#39;s Cleopatra Club and they meet Candie&#39;s lawyer, Leonide Moguy (<a href=""/name/nm0160550/"">Dennis Christopher</a>), who explains that Candie is obsessed with French culture (although Candie, unlike the actually cultured King, does not speak French). The two are brought upstairs where they watch a mandingo fight, which is very brutal and fatal for the loser, who gets his eyes gouged out by the winner. As Candie congratulates his winning mandingo, the owner of the dead mandingo, an Italian businessman named Amerigo Vessepi (Franco Nero, the star of the original &#39;Django&#39; in a suprise cameo) frets over the loss of his fighter and retires to the nearby bar for a drink. Django introduces himself to Vessepi before he walks out (a clear homage and wink-to-the-audience of the two Django actors in the same scene in the only time in this movie). It turns out that Candie is boorish and clearly arrogant and ignorant despite his wealth and high upbringing. Django is incredibly offensive to Candie and his guests, talking back to all the white men. Candie finds Django&#39;s rude and defensive behavior amusing and King to be charming. King and Django state that they are willing to pay an exorbitant amount ($12,000) for one of Candie&#39;s better mandingos and they arrange to return with him to his estate.<br/><br/>The next morning, the group travels in a convoy to the Candieland ranch. Django continues to act defiantly, insulting both slave and white man alike, and displays his intelligence. When King asks Django why he is so belligerent, Django says he is playing his role in this dirty world. Candie states that he believes one in 10,000 black men are exceptional, and believes Django to be one of those rare few.<br/><br/>At one point on the travel into Candyland, they see one of Candie&#39;s slaves chased up a tree by some of Candie&#39;s white trash work-men and their vicious hounds. It turns out the slave, D&#39;Artagnan (named by Candie after the hero from The Three Musketeers, a book written by Frenchman Alexandre Dumas, whom Candie admires), is a mandingo who was caught running away. Candie convinces D&#39;Artagnan to come down from the tree where D&#39;Artagnan pleads he can&#39;t handle any other fights despite having won three in a row. Candie states that his slaves can&#39;t retire from fighting until they have won at least five matches in order for him to recoup his $500 investment in them, and that D&#39;Artagnan must be killed. Schultz suddenly offers to pay Candie $500 to spare D&#39;Artagnan&#39;s life, but Django, realizing such odd behavior would blow their cover, loudly declares that D&#39;Artagnan isn&#39;t worth a single penny. Schultz, coming to his senses, agrees not to pay for D&#39;Artagnan, and Candie has the slave ripped to pieces by the hounds as they all look on. Django glares at Candie, but imagines himself reunited with Broomhilda to keep his anger suppressed.<br/><br/>A little later, they all arrive at Candie Land and meet Candie&#39;s widowed older sister Lara Lee (Laura Cayouette) and his loyal house-slave and foreman trustee Stephen (<a href=""/name/nm0000168/"">Samuel L. Jackson</a>). It is clear that Stephen is appalled that Django is free and riding on a horse into the estate along with his master and other white men. Django also takes an instant dislike to Stephen.<br/><br/>Stephen informs Candie that, while he was gone, Broomhilda also attempted to escape and is now locked in the Hot Box, a metal pit in Candie&#39;s field. Schultz says he wants to meet Broomhilda, saying he heard legend of her German-speaking abilities. Candie, wanting to please his guest, orders Broomhilda to be cleaned up and sent to Schultz&#39;s room. Once there, Schultz explains to Broomhilda (in German) that he and his &quot;friend&quot; are here to rescue her. He then signals Django to come into his room, and Broomhilda faints with happiness upon seeing her husband. Schultz, impressed with Broomhilda&#39;s intelligence, begins the next phase of his plan.<br/><br/>That evening at dinner, Broomhilda serves Candie and his many guests - including Schultz and Django. Lara notes that Broomhilda seems to be attracted to Django. This piques Stephen&#39;s curiosity (we see that Stephen is clearly invested in Candie&#39;s success, and forces the other slaves to call him &quot;Sir,&quot; or &quot;Mister Stephen&quot; as though he were their master) and he begins to interrogate Broomhilda in a back room. Broomhilda denies knowing Django, but Stephen knows that she is lying because she bears the same small &#39;r&#39; brand (for &quot;runaway&quot;) on the right side of her face as Django does.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Schultz, despite Django&#39;s &quot;objections,&quot; offers to buy Candie&#39;s third-best mandingo for $12,000. They agree that Schultz will return to the estate in five days with a lawyer to complete the transaction. Candie, clearly thrilled at this windfall, is then asked by King whether he can also purchase Broomhilda and take immediate possession of her (King claims he is interested in her ability to speak German, though Candie is convinced Schultz is simply sexually attracted to her).<br/><br/>Before Candie can accept the deal, Stephen interrupts and asks to speak to his master in another room. Once there, Stephen (who is drinking brandy) tells Candie that he is convinced that Django and Broomhilda know each other and that Schultz and Django intend to buy her, leave the property, and never return for the mandingo. Candie is incensed and returns to the dining room with a small bag containing the skull of an old slave of his plantation, Ben. He then explains that he collects the skulls of his dead slaves and, invoking the pseudoscience of phrenology, has determined that the reason they don&#39;t rise up and kill their masters, despite easily outnumbering the whites, is that their brains are predisposed to subservience whereas white brains are built for dominance and ingenuity. Candie then reveals he knows that they want Broomhilda, and unless they immediately pay him $12,000 for her, he will kill her and examine her skull in front of them. King immediately agrees to these terms, and Candie tells Django that he is not exceptional after all.<br/><br/>Schultz pays the $12,000 and Candie has his lawyer, Leonide Moguy, begin drawing up the papers transferring ownership of Broomhilda to King. Candie gloats about his victory and intelligence, and Schultz begins to think of D&#39;Artagnan&#39;s brutal death. The papers are signed, but before they leave, King insults Candie&#39;s intelligence, noting how especially stupid Candie is, since he names his slaves after characters in novels written by Dumas even though Dumas was a black man.<br/><br/>Candie, seeking to humiliate Schultz and recognizing that Schultz finds him to be a disgusting human being, says he will not allow the travelers to leave with Broomhilda unless King shakes his hand, a Mississippi &amp; Southern tradition. This is more than Schultz can take. As he stretches out his hand to shake Candie&#39;s hand, the spring-loaded pistol he used on the sheriff of Daughtrey pops into his right hand and fires through the flower on Candie&#39;s lapel. Candie looks down at the bullet wound, clutches his chest, staggers backwards and falls over, dead. Stephen screams, &quot;No!&quot; and rushes to Candie&#39;s side. Butch Pooch, Candie&#39;s bodyguard, turns around. Schultz apologizes to Django for being unable to resist temptation, and then Pooch fires his shotgun. The bullet hits Schultz with enough force to throw him back into a bookcase, dead.<br/><br/>Just as Schultz&#39;s body hits the ground, all hell breaks loose as Django grabs the distracted Pooch&#39;s revolver and shoots him. Moguy tries to run, screaming for help, but is shot multiple times as he tries to enter the foyer. Django then is thrown back into the foyer, and a shootout ensues as he trades fire with numerous white ranchers. Blood flies everywhere and bodies fall left, right and center. Despite taking several losses, several reinforcements of white ranchers arrive, armed with repeating rifles, where they use ladders to scale the second floor of the house to gain access and take position atop the second floor balcony where they open massive return fire against the lone Django who is forced to take cover under some furniture. The shootout ends when Django runs out of ammo, while Stephen and Billy Crash capture Broomhilda and threaten to kill her unless Django surrenders. Feeling that he has no other choice, Django does surrender and is brutally beaten by Candie&#39;s crew.<br/><br/>When Django awakens several hours later, he is naked and tied upside down in a shack. Billy Crash is preparing to castrate him with a red hot knife. Stephen enters and tells the man that the plans have changed, and Django is no longer slated for castration. After the man leaves, Stephen explains that Django would have died too quickly if he had been castrated. Stephen, wanting Django to suffer, has arranged to sell him to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company as a slave, where Django will spend the rest of his days.<br/><br/>En route to the mining company, Django is able to get the attention of one of the transporters (a group of Australians, including a cameo by director Quentin Tarantino). He tells them that he is a bounty hunter, not a slave, and that he was tracking a man worth $7,000 before he was captured. He promises that if they free and arm him, he will give them the lion&#39;s share of the reward. They find the bounty notice (from Django&#39;s first kill) on his person and also question the other slaves, who admit that Django is a bounty hunter and rode in to Candie Land with a white man on a horse. The transporters unwisely free Django, give him a pistol and he immediately kills them all and frees the other slaves bound for the mine. He takes a horse, guns, and dynamite and heads back to Candie Land.<br/><br/>Django first stops and massacres the men (trackers) who had hunted down the escaped D&#39;Artagnan with their hounds, killing them all in D&#39;Artagnan&#39;s name (the masked female tracker is played by Zoe Bell, and another tracker is played by Tom Savini). He then finds King&#39;s dead body in a stable with the freedom papers for Broomhilda still on him. After he takes the papers, Django swears that his next act of vengeance will be in honor of King.<br/><br/>Django sneaks back onto the estate and finds and frees Broomhilda. He has her wait outside Candie Land while he engages in further preparations. That evening, Candie&#39;s family and friends return from Candie&#39;s funeral, Django is there waiting and shoots them all, even Lara; despite that she is unarmed, one can conclude that because she suggested (with the help of Stephen) that Django be sent to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, so Django eliminated her. He then shoots Stephen in the kneecaps, stating that, in the 9,999 slaves Stephen has likely betrayed while working for Candie, he has never met one like Django. Stephen defiantly cries out that Django will be hunted down and killed by bounty hunters for his crimes, and that the South will never die. Django lights a fuse, and walks out on Stephen. The explosion utterly destroys Candie&#39;s mansion as Stephen still threatens Django.<br/><br/>Django meets his wife, who waits for him with two horses outside the estate. The two are finally reunited, and ride off into the night to face whatever destiny awaits them.

After the game, the coach John Harrison consoles his son Ethan who missed the final shot of the game and his team telling them that next year they are posed to take the state championship as all their best players will be returning while their opponents&#39; will have graduated.<br/><br/>In the next scene, Coach Harrison and the other teachers at the school all learn through a television news broadcast that the manufacturing plant, the largest employer in their town of Franklin, is moving to another city. Another coach explains that his best players&#39; families all work at the plant, but he assures Coach Harrison that basketball should be okay as he will still have his best players returning.<br/><br/>Cut to a scene of high school boys playing basketball in the park. A young high school girl, Hannah Scott, walks by and sees one of the boys&#39; expensive headphones lying on the bench by where they are playing. When the boy realizes they are gone and looks around, he sees Hannah. She runs through the woods with all the teenage boys chasing her. When they reach an apartment complex, they lose sight of her and assume she ran inside. Actually, she ducked behind some rocks and tried to hide her heavy breathing from the boys to keep from being discovered. We learn she has asthma when she pulls out her inhaler. After the boys give up the chase and leave, she continues on to her grandmother&#39;s house. There, her grandmother holds out an iPod and asks Hannah where it came from, insinuating she stole it and tells her to take it back saying she already bought her one. After her grandmother leaves for work, Hannah takes the stolen headphones and puts them in a box hidden in her room, presumably filled with more stolen objects, including another set of headphones.<br/><br/>In her office, Principal Olivia Brooks (Priscilla Shirer) tells Coach Harrison that the school is losing several teachers and coaches, and she needs him to coach cross country as she doesn&#39;t want the school to lose another program. He protests as he doesn&#39;t like cross country or even think that it&#39;s a real sport, but he doesn&#39;t have much of a choice. When he goes to tryouts, however, only Hannah shows up to join. She has a form signed by her grandmother, indicating she was born on Valentine&#39;s Day, and she has asthma. When the coach protests to the principal, she tells him even one runner matters.<br/><br/>At the first practice, Hannah runs a respectable, but not impressive time. Back at the Harrison home, he complains to his wife, Amy, another teacher at the school, and tries to recruit his basketball-playing son Ethan to run cross country as well. Ethan says he will only if his dad will run with him to train, so Harrison drops that idea. A phone call from their pastor reminds Amy she promised that Coach Harrison would help the pastor with hospital visitation that night.<br/><br/>At the hospital, Coach Harrison accidentally enters the room of Thomas Hill (Cameron Arnett), a blind man suffering from diabetes complications and a former cross country runner. Hill says he doesn&#39;t often have visitors and invites Harrison to come back.<br/><br/>Things go downhill for Harrison. He continues to lose basketball players and realizes he won&#39;t have a team at all, that his son will have no opportunity to get a college scholarship, and that all the teachers are getting a 10% pay cut. His wife tries to encourage him with mixed results. After Hannah&#39;s unimpressive performance at their first meet, Harrison returns to visit Hill and ask for advice on how to coach her. Along with giving suggestions on cross country coaching, Hill challenges Harrison to consider what his true identity is. If he&#39;s not a coach or a teacher or a husband or a father, then who is he? He answers that he&#39;s a Christian, and Hill asks him if his faith is so important why didn&#39;t he list it earlier.<br/><br/>Hill shares how he had to lose his own eyesight before he could clearly see what was important-how he hurt so many people and was selfish. Harrison learns that Hill had a girlfriend, got her pregnant, got her on meth, abandoned his baby girl after she died. The baby was born on Valentine&#39;s Day 15 year ago and now lives with relatives. Harrison puts the pieces together and realizes his daughter is Hannah.<br/><br/>Conflicted about what to do, as Hannah&#39;s grandmother has told her both of her parents are dead, Harrison asks Principal Brooks about the situation. We learn Brooks was a friend of Hannah&#39;s mother and has been the one paying for Hannah&#39;s tuition. She says she can&#39;t counsel the coach to go around the grandmother, but she also is sure that if they don&#39;t, Hannah will never know her father. So Amy and John ask Hill first if he would like to see Hannah, and then they ask Hannah. In their first meeting at the hospital, Hannah can only stay a few moments before she has to leave from all the emotion stirred up. She later returns and asks him to tell her what happened. Hill tells the story and says he knows he doesn&#39;t deserve it but hopes she can someday forgive him. Hannah says, &quot;It&#39;s hard.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah and Principal Brooks talk about all Hannah&#39;s feelings about her father-about feeling unloved, a mistake, unwanted, abandoned. Principal Brooks tells Hannah that she has another father, a perfect Father who has always wanted her and loved her and cares for her. They pray together, and Hannah asks Jesus Christ to be part of her life. Principal Brooks challenges Hannah to read the first two chapters of the book of Ephesians in the Bible and to write down all the things it says about her.<br/><br/>She writes down things like: &quot;I am blessed. I am chosen. I am forgiven. I am redeemed. I am loved.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah dramatically declares all of these things in front of Coach Harrison, and the drama class at school then returns all the things she had been stealing. She goes to her father&#39;s hospital room and finds it empty. Grateful to find he was only moved to ICU after a possible heart attack, Hannah informs him she has two things to tell him. First, she has given her life to Christ and second, if Jesus can forgive her for all the things that she has done, then she can forgive him. Of course, he is thrilled.<br/><br/>When Hannah returns home, she finds her grandmother has come home early from work and is livid when Hannah tells her she was visiting her father. She feels betrayed. She tells Hannah that she was trying to protect her by keeping her away from him. Her grandmother goes to the Harrisons&#39; home and threatens them and the school with legal action if they ever help her see him again. Then she goes to Hill&#39;s hospital room and tells him to let her go, that he only brings hurt to everyone.<br/><br/>All of them pray. The Harrisons pray together for wisdom on what to do. Hill prays that God wouldn&#39;t leave him useless after just getting back his daughter. Hannah&#39;s grandmother prays that God would help her to forgive all of the hurt of losing her daughter, of working so hard all these years to take care of Hannah. She says only God can do it.<br/><br/>At a meeting of the regional cross country coaches before the state championship, a vote is taken on whether or not to allow runners to use earbuds. At first, opposed, Harrison quickly changes his mind and lobbies the other coaches to vote in favor as well.<br/><br/>At the state championship, Coach Harrison gives Hannah an earbud and a player telling him to push the play button when the race starts. She does, and she hears the voice of her father coaching her through every step of the race. He tells her how much he loves her, how proud he is of her, how they are going to do this together. He coaches her to find her pace, to dig into the hills, to pass girl after girl. With the encouragement and expert coaching of her father, Hannah runs her best race ever and literally falls over the finish line, having given her everything to overtake the former state champion in the last stretch. As paramedics bring oxygen for Hannah, everyone waits for the final results, which were too close to call without review. When they determine Hannah won by leaning forward an inch more; her classmates hoist her on their shoulders and everyone cheers. Hannah&#39;s grandmother stayed to watch her race even though it meant she was late for work. After her congratulations, Hannah tells her she wants to see her dad, and her grandmother nods and tells the Harrisons to bring her home after.<br/><br/>At the hospital, Hannah puts the medal around her father&#39;s neck. He is thrilled that she medaled. Then Coach Harrison tells him it&#39;s not just any medal; she won the state championship. Hannah wraps her arms around him, puts her head on his chest, and says, &quot;I had a really good coach.&quot;<br/><br/>Hill&#39;s casket at the cemetery is surrounded by Hannah, her grandmother, the Harrisons, Principal Brooks, and others. The pastor says Hill&#39;s story was one of redemption. Hannah tells Coach Harrison that she &quot;had the best dad in the world for six weeks.&quot;<br/><br/>The last scenes are six years later. We see Hannah sharing her story with others in a group, scenes of her running cross country in college, and her opening up a box tied with a ribbon (one of a whole set that Coach Harrison apparently has in a drawer that he mails on her birthday) and inserting a flash drive into her player and running through the city while listening to a recording made by her father for her saying, &quot;This is your 21st birthday, Hannah. This is the prayer I have prayed for you for this year...&quot;</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","['Alex Kendrick', 'Alex Kendrick', 'Stephen Kendrick', 'Alex Kendrick', 'Shari Rigby', 'Aryn Wright', 'Alex Kendrick', 'Shari Rigby', 'Aryn Wright', 'Cameron Arnett', 'Priscilla C', 'Jack Sterner', 'Ben Davies', 'Denise Armstrong', 'Kendrick Cross', 'Holly A', 'Myke Holmes', 'Micah Lynn Hanson', 'Karen Boles', 'Elizabeth Becka', 'Jared Staley']","['John Harrison  ', 'Amy Harrison  ', 'Hannah Scott  ', 'Thomas Hill  ', 'Olivia Brooks  ', 'Ethan Harrison  ', 'Coach Myers  ', 'Barbara Scott  ', 'Ken Jones  ', 'Cindy Hatcher  ', 'Troy Finkle  ', 'Nurse Kathryn  ', 'Coach Karen  ', 'Mrs. Charles  ', 'Wesley Ford  ']"

Rick&#39;s mood turns around since he thinks that a big time director like Polanski (hot off directing the recent thriller &quot;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&quot;) can help reinvigorate his career. He goes to rehearse his lines for &quot;Lancer&quot; for the night. Cliff then drives home to his trailer where he lives alone with his dog Brandy.<br/><br/>Polanski brings Sharon to a party at the Playboy Mansion, where they meet with their friends Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch), Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis), and Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse). Sharon goes to dance, while McQueen talks to Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker). He notes that Sharon is using Polanski to make Jay jealous, and Connie thinks that Sharon has a type - short men that &quot;look like 12-year-old boys&quot;.<br/><br/>Sunday, February 9th, 1969<br/><br/>After Polanski leaves, Sharon hangs out with Jay at her house. Visiting them is Charles Manson (Damon Herriman), claiming that he is coming to see his friends, the previous owners of the house that Polanski and Sharon now live in. He apologizes for the error and leaves.<br/><br/>Cliff brings Rick to the set of &quot;Lancer&quot; for the day&#39;s shoot. He goes back to Rick&#39;s house after he asks Cliff to fix the antenna on his roof. He happens to spot Manson as he leaves, and he smiles and waves at Cliff. We then see a flashback to Rick talking to an old friend of his, Randy (Kurt Russell), into getting Cliff a gig. Randy shows reluctance, since it is rumored that Cliff murdered his wife Billie (Rebecca Gayheart) and got away with it. The alleged incident is shown on a boat where Billie was nagging Cliff endlessly, but it cuts away before we see if Cliff really did shoot Billie with the harpoon gun he was holding. Randy brings Cliff to the set, where he meets Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) talking about wanting to fight boxer Muhammad Ali. When Lee catches Cliff laughing at what he&#39;s saying, he challenges him to a fight to see who knocks who on the ground first. Lee gets Cliff down first, and he retaliates by grabbing Lee and slamming him into a car. The two then go hand-to-hand until Janet (Zoe Bell), Randy&#39;s wife and fellow stunt coordinator comes in and is pissed to see Cliff and Lee fighting, and the huge dent that Cliff left in there, meaning he&#39;s fired.<br/><br/>Sharon goes to the local movie theater and sees that a film she is featured in, &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, is playing. She goes to the box office and asks for a ticket, but then asks if she gets any privilege for starring in the film. The manager comes out and recognizes Sharon from &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and he invites her in. Throughout the film, Sharon listens to the audience&#39;s enthusiastic reactions to her performance, with laughter and cheering at the right moments.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rick goes through his hair and make-up for &quot;Lancer&quot;. He then sits down next to his eight-year-old co-star Trudi (Julia Butters), who is a method actor. Rick smokes a cigarette near her as she reads her book. They have a conversation about the books they are reading, and Rick has a small breakdown over his perceived decline in stardom. Shooting begins, and Rick works with the series lead actor, James Stacey (Timothy Olyphant), who plays protagonist Johnny Madrid. During the take, Rick forgets his lines due to being drunk. He goes to his trailer and has a meltdown, but then vows to do better.<br/><br/>Cliff drives home from Rick&#39;s place and sees a hitchhiker called Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), whom Cliff has noticed throughout the weekend. He picks her up and agrees to take her to the Spahn Ranch, where Cliff used to shoot films with Rick. When they get there, Cliff sees that the place has become some kind of commune for hippies, mostly consisting of women. Pussycat tells Cliff that he should stick around to meet Manson, but he wants to speak with the ranch&#39;s elderly owner, George Spahn (Bruce Dern). The women warn Cliff that Spahn is sleeping, but he goes over to his house anyway. He is met by Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme (Dakota Fanning), who also reiterates that Spahn is asleep because she just had sex with him. Cliff goes to wake Spahn up, but he doesn&#39;t recognize Cliff since he is blind. He asks Spahn if the women there are taking advantage of him, but Spahn denies it and tells Cliff to leave. Outside, Cliff sees one of the male hippie&#39;s stuck a knife in his front tire. He gets his stuff out and orders the man to fix it, but is given a &quot;fuck you&quot;. Cliff responds by decking the guy hard in the face three times in front of the other women. They run to get Tex Watson (Austin Butler), but Cliff is already driving away by the time he gets out.<br/><br/>Back on the &quot;Lancer&quot; set, Rick shoots a scene where he has Trudi&#39;s character hostage, and Scott Lancer, played by Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry), comes to intervene. Rick improvises his slimy villain character and has a moment where he throws Trudi off of him. After the take, he is praised by both the director and Trudi, who tells Rick that it was the best acting she has ever seen in her life. The comment even moves Rick to tears.<br/><br/>Six months later.<br/><br/>A voice-over from Randy states that Rick and Cliff ended up flying to Rome to shoot the Spaghetti Western films. While there, Rick met and married Italian film actress Francesca Capucci (Lorenza Izzo).<br/><br/>August 8th, 1969<br/><br/>Rick and Cliff have returned to Los Angeles, but now feel that it is time for them to go their separate ways. They spend one last night having drinks and hang out at Rick&#39;s home with Francesca. Meanwhile, Sharon, now very pregnant, is having a small gathering with Jay, and their friends Wojciech Frykowski (Costa Ronin) and Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson).<br/><br/>Cliff takes out a cigarette he bought from Pussycat that was dipped in acid, and he proceeds to smoke it to trip out. Outside, Tex drives in front of the houses with fellow &quot;family&quot; members Patricia Krenwinkel, AKA Katie (Madisen Beaty), Susan Atkins, AKA Sadie (Mikey Madison), and Linda Kasabian, AKA Flowerchild (Maya Hawke). They arrive with the intention of killing Sharon and her friends, but a drunk Rick comes out and angrily yells at them because their car&#39;s busted muffler is making too much noise. He orders them to leave, even as Katie appears to be reaching for her gun, but Tex drives away. At the bottom of the hill, the four recognize Rick from TV, and Sadie suggests that they kill him and whoever else is in his house. The others agree, but as they start walking there, Flowerchild says she forgot her knife. Tex gives her the car keys to get it, but she ends up ditching them and driving away. The three then proceed to carry out their plan.<br/><br/>The trio walk up to Rick&#39;s house. Tex and Katie break in through the front, while Sadie goes in through the side. Cliff sees them, but because he is tripping balls, he is neither frightened nor absolutely certain of what he is seeing. Even as Tex draws his gun on Cliff, he instead sics Brandy on Tex, who viciously chomps into Tex&#39;s arm and groin. Sadie tries to run up to Cliff with her knife, but he chucks a can of dog food at her, which smashes into her face. Cliff stomps Tex&#39;s face in before grabbing Sadie and brutally smashing her face against the hard furniture until she is dead. Brandy gets a few bites into Sadie as well, but she runs out flailing and shrieking into the pool, where Rick is lounging. He then comes out with his FLAMETHROWER and torches Sadie, who burns to death in his pool. In the chaos, Cliff gets shot, but non-fatally.<br/><br/>Paramedics and police arrive at the scene. Cliff is taken to the hospital for his injuries, while Francesca is freaked out by the ordeal. After Rick says bye to Cliff, he sees Jay calling to him from Sharon&#39;s gate. Rick explains what happened, and Jay recognizes Rick from TV. Jay tells Sharon who her neighbor is, and they invite him to come over for a drink. Rick agrees, and he finally meets Sharon and her friends.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","['Quentin Tarantino', 'Quentin Tarantino', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Brad Pitt', 'Margot Robbie', 'Riz Ahmed', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Brad Pitt', 'Margot Robbie', 'Emile Hirsch', 'Margaret Qualley', 'Timothy Olyphant', 'Julia Butters', 'Austin Butler', 'Dakota Fanning', 'Bruce Dern', 'Mike Moh', 'Luke Perry', 'Damian Lewis', 'Al Pacino', 'Nicholas Hammond', 'Nico Fidenco', 'Cantori Moderni Di ']","['Rick Dalton', 'Cliff Booth', 'Sharon Tate', 'Jay Sebring', 'Pussycat', 'James Stacy', 'Trudi', 'Tex', 'Bruce Lee', 'Wayne Maunder', 'Marvin Schwarz', 'Sam Wanamaker', 'Squeaky Fromme  ', 'George Spahn  ', 'Steve McQueen  ']"

Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) have arrived to investigate the area after a reported cyclone &quot;with a face&quot; had torn through the city. Moments later, the two encounter a being known as an Elemental, specifically the one that can manipulate earth. Fury and Maria are met by a man in a super-powered suit named Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), and he helps the two fight the Earth Elemental.<br/><br/>Cut to Midtown School of Science and Technology where Betty Brant (Angourie Rice) and Jason Ionello (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr) are doing their daily school news report, but they start with an &quot;In Memoriam&quot; dedicated to Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Vision. Betty recaps the events of The Snap (or &quot;The Blip&quot;, as it is called here from &#39;Avengers: Endgame&#39;), with many students having been dusted away before returning to life and finding that some of their younger classmates have now surpassed them physically.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tom Holland) discusses with Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) his plans to win over Michelle Jones/MJ (Zendaya), on whom he has developed a crush. They are prepping for a class trip to Europe, and Peter hopes that he can tell her how he feels.<br/><br/>Peter later attends a fundraiser as Spider-Man, with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) there to support him (and we learn that she got &quot;blipped&quot; too). They are met by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who appears to be flirting with May. He gives Peter a heads-up that Fury is going to call him, which he does almost instantly, but Peter ignores him since he has other things to worry about. He returns outside as Spidey to talk to reporters, but they overwhelm him with questions about becoming the new Iron Man or the next lead Avenger, so he leaves.<br/><br/>The class later heads out for the trip, with Peter choosing to leave the Spidey suit behind to enjoy his vacation, but he later finds that May packed it for him anyway. They are chaperoned by Mr. Harrington (Martin Starr) and Mr. Dell (J.B. Smoove), and are joined by other students, including Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), who is still a big Spidey fan but also still dumps on Peter. On the plane, Peter tries to get Ned to help him switch seats so that he can sit with MJ, but Ned only causes Mr. Harrington to take Peter while MJ is seated next to Brad Davis (Remy Hii), who is one of the kids that didn&#39;t get dusted and grew into a handsome athletic superstar. Peter is clearly jealous, while Ned sits next to Betty, and they end up becoming a couple.<br/><br/>The class arrives in Venice, Italy for their first stop. They stay in a crummy hotel, but they take time to enjoy the sights, while Peter tries to get closer to MJ. Suddenly, the water levels on the ground start rising. Soon, a massive Water Elemental begins to wreak havoc upon the city, using water to flood the city or destroy buildings. Peter tries to do something about it, but he left his Spidey suit at the hotel. Beck arrives and uses his powers to fight the Water Elemental. He is able to subdue the creature&#39;s attacks before ultimately splitting the creature in two. He is seen as a hero by Peter&#39;s classmates, and after watching a news report on him, they start to call him &quot;Mysterio&quot;.<br/><br/>Peter and Ned go back to their room, but Ned gets tranquilized by Fury. He has been trying to get Peter&#39;s attention, and it hasn&#39;t worked until now. They have to leave the room to talk in private since everyone keeps interrupting them. Fury takes Peter to his secret hideout to meet Maria and Beck. Beck explains that he is from an alternate Earth, which is where the Elementals are coming from. This was supposedly caused by The Snap, and Beck claims that the Fire Elemental was the one that destroyed his home world and his family. Fury wants Peter&#39;s help in fighting back, but he feels he isn&#39;t the Avenger that is qualified to fight beings like these.<br/><br/>Fury hijacks the class&#39;s vacation by having his employee, Dimitri (Numan Acar), act as a driver to their new and unexpected destination, Prague, as Fury and Beck have learned that&#39;s where the Fire Elemental is set to strike. Before heading out, Peter is taken by a tall woman sent by Fury to give him a stealth suit. She orders him to take off his clothes and put it on, but he is found by Brad, who takes a pic of Peter in what looks like a compromising position. Peter runs after him to get rid of the pic, but Brad says he knows that Peter likes MJ too, and he thinks showing her this will make her lean more toward Brad. On their trip, Peter finds Tony&#39;s high-tech glasses, EDITH (voice of Dawn Michelle King) (stands for &quot;Even Dead, I&#39;m The Hero&quot;), which Tony left for his successor. Peter asks EDITH to handle Brad, which is misinterpreted as a request for an attack. Peter has to (somewhat) discreetly stop the incoming drone from killing Brad, as well as the whole class. He just has EDITH hack into Brad&#39;s phone and delete the picture.<br/><br/>After arriving in Prague, Mr. Harrington tells the students that they were given tickets to the opera, which ruins their plans to go to the carnival, but it was planned by Fury to keep Peter&#39;s friends inside to avoid being caught in the path of the Fire Elemental. Peter is forced to stay outside and be on the lookout, which ruins HIS plan to sit next to MJ. She follows him outside, and Ned and Betty follow since they think the other two are headed for the carnival. Outside, the Fire Elemental emerges and begins to rampage. Spidey and Mysterio team up against the beast, trying to avoid letting it touch metal, or else it will get more powerful. Ned and Betty are trapped on the Ferris wheel as Spidey tries to save them, while Mysterio fights the Fire Elemental. Spidey fires a web at the beast, which pulls something out of it and makes it land near a hidden MJ. Mysterio then uses his powers to dive into the Fire Elemental&#39;s chest and destroy it. Peter goes down to make sure he is okay. However, he still gets chewed out by Fury for not doing what he told him to.<br/><br/>As the gang moves to Berlin, Peter and Beck are called by Fury and Maria to discuss forming a new team. Peter privately meets with Beck, and Peter thinks that Beck is the one that truly deserves EDITH, since he thinks Tony only left it for him to choose who is worthy of succeeding Iron Man. After Peter leaves, Beck takes down what has been a whole illusion in a dilapidated building. Everyone there works for him, and they are all disgruntled former employees of Stark Industries. Beck has been making up the Elementals to get people to see him as the hero, using drones to create the destruction left behind by their appearances. He and everyone there have been pissed at Tony for stealing their work, his Binary Augmented Retro Framing (BARF), and they have all worked together to get people to forget about Iron Man or Spider-Man, and to make way for Mysterio.<br/><br/>Peter goes back to the hotel to invite MJ to go out with him without anybody else. As he tries to tell her how he feels, she cuts him off to reveal she knows he&#39;s Spider-Man, due to the many &quot;coincidences&quot; involving them being in the same places at the same time. She then pulls out what she found at the site of the Fire Elemental fight, a projector that shows Mysterio fighting the as-yet-unseen Air Elemental. The two realize that Beck is behind the Elementals and that he is a fraud. As Beck and his goons prepare for the Air Elemental &quot;Avengers level&quot; attack, they find that the missing projector from one of their drones is in Peter&#39;s hands.<br/><br/>Peter goes to meet with Fury and Maria about Beck&#39;s true motives, but it turns out Beck has caught up to Peter first and has created an entire illusion to trap him in. He taunts Peter for not being the hero he wants to be, and even forces him to endure a projection of Tony bursting from his grave and coming out to terrorize him. It appears as though Fury subdues Beck and asks Peter who else he told about Beck, and he admits that he told MJ, Ned, and that Ned probably told Betty. This turns out to be another one of Beck&#39;s tricks, and now he knows to kill Peter&#39;s friends. He also puts Peter in the path of a train, which appears to strike him, but Peter is merely hurt really bad, and he passes out on the train.<br/><br/>Peter wakes up in a jail cell in the Netherlands. After breaking out, he calls Happy to come get him. While Happy tends to his wounds, Peter breaks down and says that he doesn&#39;t get why Tony would pick him as a successor when he keeps screwing everything up. Happy reassures him that Tony believed in him for a reason, and that he knew Peter would be the hero he needs to be. Peter picks himself up and goes to create himself a new suit from Tony&#39;s computer before they head to London to rescue his friends.<br/><br/>The class is taking a tour bus ride around London, but it&#39;s driven by one of Beck&#39;s goons. They stop on the London Bridge as Mysterio gets the Air Elemental ready to attack. Spidey shows up in a new suit for battle. Happy goes to get Ned, MJ, Betty, and Flash, but his jet gets blown up and they have to hide in a medieval tower as the drones go after them. They hide in a room, but MJ manages to knock down a drone with a mace before having to stay locked in a room. Spidey enters the illusion of the Air Elemental and webs all the drones together to get them to crash and break the illusion. He proceeds to destroy more drones before Mysterio has him cornered and faces a horde of drones directed at him while under an illusion. Using his Spider-Sense, Spidey dodges all the drones, destroys them all, and in the chaos, one of them shoots Mysterio. Peter goes to get EDITH, but Beck attempts one last illusion to kill him, and it fails, leaving Beck to die in disgrace. Peter then disables all the drones. Afterwards, he and MJ run onto the bridge to meet with each other. They acknowledge their mutual feelings, and they kiss. Fury tries to get Peter again, but Happy tells him to leave the kid alone since he&#39;s with his new girlfriend.<br/><br/>The students return home. Peter sits Happy and May down to discuss their apparently developing relationship, but while Happy thinks they are an item, May thinks they just had a fling. Peter then goes out to meet MJ for a date as Spidey. He takes her for a swing around the city, although the heights freak her out.<br/><br/>Mid-Credits: After their &quot;date&quot;, Spidey drops MJ off in the streets. They then overhear a breaking news broadcast in the middle of the city. Apparently, Beck recorded a video before his death and sent it to the Daily Bugle. It is shown by none other than the ruthless and antagonistic chief editor J. Jonah Jameson (played by none other than J.K. Simmons), and what plays is a doctored video done by Beck to make people think Spider-Man orchestrated the drone attacks on London. Beck then outs Spidey as Peter Parker to the whole city, leaving New Yorkers in disbelief over their hero, and putting Peter in a very troubling position...<br/><br/>Post-Credits: Fury and Maria are revealed to have been the Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his wife Soren (Sharon Blynn). They were ordered by Fury to give EDITH to Peter, and Talos gives Fury an update on what had just happened. Fury is then shown to be relaxing on a Skrull ship, which he is apparently commandeering.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","['Jon Watts', 'Chris McKenna', 'Erik Sommers', 'Tom Holland', 'Samuel L', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Tom Holland', 'Samuel L', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Marisa Tomei', 'Jon Favreau', 'Zendaya', 'Jacob Batalon', 'Tony Revolori', 'Angourie Rice', 'Remy Hii', 'Martin Starr', 'J.B', 'Jorge Lendeborg Jr', 'Cobie Smulders', 'Numan Acar', 'Mick Giacchino']","['Peter Parker', 'Spider', 'Nick Fury', 'Quentin Beck', 'Mysterio', 'May Parker', 'Happy Hogan', 'MJ', 'Ned Leeds', 'Flash Thompson', 'Betty Brant', 'Brad Davis', 'Mr', 'Mr', 'Maria Hill', 'Dimitri', 'Jason Ionello  ']"
