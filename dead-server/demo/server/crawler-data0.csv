As he suffers from insomnia, he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night, watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day, or thinking about how the world, New York in particular, has deteriorated into a cesspool. He&#39;s a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him, the one bright spot in New York humanity is Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. He becomes obsessed with her. After an incident with her, he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place in his opinion. One of his priorities is to be the savior for Iris, a twelve-year-old runaway and prostitute who he believes wants out of the profession and under the thumb of her pimp and lover Matthew.</p>\n                        <div class=""author-container"">\n                            <em>&mdash;<a href=""/search/title?plot_author=Huggo&view=simple&sort=alpha&ref_=ttpl_pl_1"">Huggo</a></em>\n                        </div>\n                </li>\n                <li class=""ipl-zebra-list__item"" id=""summary-ps2454854"">\n                    <p>The former marine Travis Bickle is insomniac and decides to work as taxi driver in the night shift.

Travis claims that he is an honorably discharged Marine (it is implied that he is a Vietnam Veteran). After making an impression on the personnel officer, Travis gets the job for the night shift due to his chronic insomnia.<br/><br/>Via his narrative journal, Travis is soon revealed to be a lonely and depressed young man of 26 years. His origins and hometown are unknown. He sends his parents letters as well as birthday and Christmas cards, lying about his life and saying he works with the Secret Service. Travis spends his restless days alone in his rundown apartment somewhere in Manhattan, or in seedy porn theaters on and off 42nd Street. At one porn theater he tries to make an advance on the concession lady to no avail. He works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Sometimes during his breaks, he goes to a local all-night diner to have something to eat or just a few cups of coffee where fellow taxi drivers also hang out during their late-night lunch breaks. One of whom is a self-appointed philosophical type named Wizard (Peter Boyle). Wizard talks about the degradation of the night time in the city. Travis barely interacts with the other taxi drivers, mainly speaking awkwardly and shyly when he&#39;s spoken to.<br/><br/>During taxi driving, Travis spies and becomes infatuated with a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine, who is running for the presidential nomination and is promising dramatic social change. Travis spies Betsy joking with a co-worker named Tom (Albert Brooks). Travis works up the nerve to ask her out and Betsy is initially intrigued by Travis. She agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. She compares him to a character in the Kris Kristofferson song &quot;The Pilgrim.&quot;<br/><br/>Travis is further revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Shocked by the occurrence Travis fails to drive off quickly enough and her pimp, &quot;Sport&quot; (Harvey Keitel), reaches the cab. Sport forcibly grabs Iris away with him and gives Travis a crumpled twenty dollar bill as a bribe not to say anything, which haunts Travis with the memory of his failure to help the girl.<br/><br/>During one of his shifts, Travis picks up Senator Palantine himself (Leonard Harris) and an aide. He tells the senator he plans to vote for him and the senator, acting like a real politician, tells Travis he learns more from cab drivers than limo drivers. The senator asks Travis &quot;what&#39;s the one thing that bugs you the most?&quot; and Travis responds that he would like the next president to &quot;clean the scum off New York City.&quot;<br/><br/>On their date, however due to his lack of social skills, Travis takes Betsy to a porno theater to view a hardcore Swedish &quot;sex education&quot; film (titled: Language of Love). Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain and she refuses to speak with him. Going back into the campaign office, Travis confronts Betsy and shouts that she will &quot;burn in hell like the rest of them&quot;.<br/><br/>Rejected and depressed, Travis later picks up a man (director Martin Scorsese) who appears to be as mentally unbalanced as he is. The man tells Travis to park outside an apartment building while letting the meter run. He tells Travis to look at the woman in the window and tells him that&#39;s his wife in her boyfriend&#39;s apartment. He tells Travis he plans to kill them both with a .44 Magnum.<br/><br/>One evening at the diner, Travis approaches and tries to express his despair to Wizard, but when Wizard makes a half-hearted response to Travis&#39; problems with the teen prostitute and others, Travis angrily responds with: &quot;that&#39;s just about the stupidest thing I ever heard&quot;.<br/><br/>Travis&#39;s thoughts turn more violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime (especially prostitution) that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and buys a number of pistols from an illegal drug/weapons dealer (Steven Prince).<br/><br/>Travis develops an ominously intense interest in Senator Palantine&#39;s public appearances and it seems that he somehow blames the presidential hopeful for his own failure at wooing Betsy and maybe hopes to include her boss in his growing list of targets. Back at his apartment with his newly purchased guns, he begins a program of intense physical training and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm (&quot;You talkin&#39; to me?&quot;). Later, he hangs around a Palantine rally and asks a suspicious secret service man about joining the service before disappearing into the crowd.<br/><br/>In an accidental warm-up, Travis randomly walks into a robbery in a run-down grocery store and shoots the would-be thief (Nat Grant) in the face; adding to the bizarre violence, the sympathetic grocery owner (Victor Argo) encourages Travis (who has no permit for his guns) to flee the scene and then proceeds to club the near-dead stickup man to death with a steel pole.<br/><br/>Later, seeing Iris on the street, he follows her. Another day later, Travis asks to pay for her time, and is sent to Sport. A tense conversation ensues but Sport sends Travis up to Iris&#39;s room. Once in her room, Travis does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind.<br/><br/>The next day, Travis and Iris meet for breakfast at a local coffee shop and Travis becomes obsessed with saving this naïve child-woman who thinks hanging out with hookers, pimps and drug dealers is more &quot;hip&quot; than dating young boys and going to school. Iris considers Travis&#39;s offer but then Sport seduces and convinces her to stay, while (seemingly) Travis spies into the window from his cab. Travis writes a note to Iris including all his money and stating that he doesn&#39;t intend to survive.<br/><br/>Any lingering doubt in the viewer&#39;s mind about Travis Bickle&#39;s sanity is obliterated when he is suddenly and shockingly shown to be sporting a crude Mohawk haircut at a public rally. He creeps through the crowd and prepares to assassinate Senator Palantine but is spotted by Secret Service men and flees.<br/><br/>Travis returns to his apartment to collect all his guns, then drives to &quot;Alphabet City&quot; (an area of New York&#39;s Lower East side consisting of Avenues A through E). He walks up to Sport and confronts him. When Sport flicks a lit cigarette at him, Travis says &quot;suck on this&quot; and shoots Sport in the belly. Storming into the brothel, Travis blows the bouncer&#39;s hand off. Sport, who has followed Travis, grazes Travis neck with a bullet (causing an arterial gush from his neck) but Travis unloads one of his guns into Sport, killing him. Travis again shoots the screaming bouncer who follows him up the stairs, slapping him. Iris&#39; mafioso customer shoots Travis in the arm and Travis shoots his face off. The bouncer tackles Travis but Travis stabs him through the hand and finally kills the bouncer with a bullet to the brain. He then calmly tries repeatedly to fire a bullet into his own head under his chin but all the weapons are empty so he resigns himself to resting on a convenient sofa until police arrive. When they do, the blood-soaked Travis mimes shooting himself in the head and then blissfully thinks of the mayhem and carnage in his wake.<br/><br/>A brief epilogue shows Travis recuperating from the incident. He has received a handwritten letter from Iris&#39; parents who thank him for saving their daughter, and the media (in newspaper clipping) hails him as a hero for saving her as well. Travis blithely returns to his job and suddenly seems on more friendly terms with the other cabbies. One night one of his fares happens to be Betsy. She comments about his saving of Iris and Travis&#39; own media fame, yet Travis denies being any sort of hero. He drops her off without charging her. As he is driving off, he gets a strange look on his face and adjusts his cab&#39;s rear view mirror, giving the impression that his irrationality is about to break through again.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Concession Girl', 'Melio', 'Wizard', 'Tom', 'Cabbie in', 'Travis Bickle', 'Iris', 'Stick', 'Charles Palantine']"

It features action star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the lead role as Jake Cahill, a renegade bounty hunter. Following the clip is an interview with Rick and his stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), both of whom describe Cliff&#39;s role as essentially carrying Rick&#39;s load.<br/><br/>Saturday, February 8th, 1969<br/><br/>Rick and Cliff are in a restaurant where Rick is met by producer Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino). He is a fan of Rick&#39;s work, having seen a double feature presentation of his where he plays an action star, including one where he is a GI that incinerates Nazis with a flamethrower (which he kept). Marvin also brings up a cheesy music video Rick was featured in. &quot;Bounty Law&quot; has since been canceled because of Rick&#39;s ongoing alcoholism (which is also why Cliff is his driver), and now Rick has booked a gig as a villain on the series &quot;Lancer.&quot; Marvin thinks Rick ought to fly to Rome and shoot Spaghetti Westerns. Rick complains to Cliff about how this means that his career is going downhill, and he is now a has-been.<br/><br/>Cliff drives Rick home, where they learn that Rick&#39;s new neighbors are director Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) and his wife, rising starlet Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Rick&#39;s mood turns around since he thinks that a big time director like Polanski (hot off directing the recent thriller &quot;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&quot;) can help reinvigorate his career. He goes to rehearse his lines for &quot;Lancer&quot; for the night. Cliff then drives home to his trailer where he lives alone with his dog Brandy.<br/><br/>Polanski brings Sharon to a party at the Playboy Mansion, where they meet with their friends Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch), Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis), and Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse). Sharon goes to dance, while McQueen talks to Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker). He notes that Sharon is using Polanski to make Jay jealous, and Connie thinks that Sharon has a type - short men that &quot;look like 12-year-old boys&quot;.<br/><br/>Sunday, February 9th, 1969<br/><br/>After Polanski leaves, Sharon hangs out with Jay at her house. Visiting them is Charles Manson (Damon Herriman), claiming that he is coming to see his friends, the previous owners of the house that Polanski and Sharon now live in. He apologizes for the error and leaves.<br/><br/>Cliff brings Rick to the set of &quot;Lancer&quot; for the day&#39;s shoot. He goes back to Rick&#39;s house after he asks Cliff to fix the antenna on his roof. He happens to spot Manson as he leaves, and he smiles and waves at Cliff. We then see a flashback to Rick talking to an old friend of his, Randy (Kurt Russell), into getting Cliff a gig. Randy shows reluctance, since it is rumored that Cliff murdered his wife Billie (Rebecca Gayheart) and got away with it. The alleged incident is shown on a boat where Billie was nagging Cliff endlessly, but it cuts away before we see if Cliff really did shoot Billie with the harpoon gun he was holding. Randy brings Cliff to the set, where he meets Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) talking about wanting to fight boxer Muhammad Ali. When Lee catches Cliff laughing at what he&#39;s saying, he challenges him to a fight to see who knocks who on the ground first. Lee gets Cliff down first, and he retaliates by grabbing Lee and slamming him into a car. The two then go hand-to-hand until Janet (Zoe Bell), Randy&#39;s wife and fellow stunt coordinator comes in and is pissed to see Cliff and Lee fighting, and the huge dent that Cliff left in there, meaning he&#39;s fired.<br/><br/>Sharon goes to the local movie theater and sees that a film she is featured in, &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, is playing. She goes to the box office and asks for a ticket, but then asks if she gets any privilege for starring in the film. The manager comes out and recognizes Sharon from &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and he invites her in. Throughout the film, Sharon listens to the audience&#39;s enthusiastic reactions to her performance, with laughter and cheering at the right moments.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rick goes through his hair and make-up for &quot;Lancer&quot;. He then sits down next to his eight-year-old co-star Trudi (Julia Butters), who is a method actor. Rick smokes a cigarette near her as she reads her book. They have a conversation about the books they are reading, and Rick has a small breakdown over his perceived decline in stardom. Shooting begins, and Rick works with the series lead actor, James Stacey (Timothy Olyphant), who plays protagonist Johnny Madrid. During the take, Rick forgets his lines due to being drunk. He goes to his trailer and has a meltdown, but then vows to do better.<br/><br/>Cliff drives home from Rick&#39;s place and sees a hitchhiker called Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), whom Cliff has noticed throughout the weekend. He picks her up and agrees to take her to the Spahn Ranch, where Cliff used to shoot films with Rick. When they get there, Cliff sees that the place has become some kind of commune for hippies, mostly consisting of women. Pussycat tells Cliff that he should stick around to meet Manson, but he wants to speak with the ranch&#39;s elderly owner, George Spahn (Bruce Dern). The women warn Cliff that Spahn is sleeping, but he goes over to his house anyway. He is met by Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme (Dakota Fanning), who also reiterates that Spahn is asleep because she just had sex with him. Cliff goes to wake Spahn up, but he doesn&#39;t recognize Cliff since he is blind. He asks Spahn if the women there are taking advantage of him, but Spahn denies it and tells Cliff to leave. Outside, Cliff sees one of the male hippie&#39;s stuck a knife in his front tire. He gets his stuff out and orders the man to fix it, but is given a &quot;fuck you&quot;. Cliff responds by decking the guy hard in the face three times in front of the other women. They run to get Tex Watson (Austin Butler), but Cliff is already driving away by the time he gets out.<br/><br/>Back on the &quot;Lancer&quot; set, Rick shoots a scene where he has Trudi&#39;s character hostage, and Scott Lancer, played by Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry), comes to intervene. Rick improvises his slimy villain character and has a moment where he throws Trudi off of him. After the take, he is praised by both the director and Trudi, who tells Rick that it was the best acting she has ever seen in her life. The comment even moves Rick to tears.<br/><br/>Six months later.<br/><br/>A voice-over from Randy states that Rick and Cliff ended up flying to Rome to shoot the Spaghetti Western films. While there, Rick met and married Italian film actress Francesca Capucci (Lorenza Izzo).<br/><br/>August 8th, 1969<br/><br/>Rick and Cliff have returned to Los Angeles, but now feel that it is time for them to go their separate ways. They spend one last night having drinks and hang out at Rick&#39;s home with Francesca. Meanwhile, Sharon, now very pregnant, is having a small gathering with Jay, and their friends Wojciech Frykowski (Costa Ronin) and Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson).<br/><br/>Cliff takes out a cigarette he bought from Pussycat that was dipped in acid, and he proceeds to smoke it to trip out. Outside, Tex drives in front of the houses with fellow &quot;family&quot; members Patricia Krenwinkel, AKA Katie (Madisen Beaty), Susan Atkins, AKA Sadie (Mikey Madison), and Linda Kasabian, AKA Flowerchild (Maya Hawke). They arrive with the intention of killing Sharon and her friends, but a drunk Rick comes out and angrily yells at them because their car&#39;s busted muffler is making too much noise. He orders them to leave, even as Katie appears to be reaching for her gun, but Tex drives away. At the bottom of the hill, the four recognize Rick from TV, and Sadie suggests that they kill him and whoever else is in his house. The others agree, but as they start walking there, Flowerchild says she forgot her knife. Tex gives her the car keys to get it, but she ends up ditching them and driving away. The three then proceed to carry out their plan.<br/><br/>The trio walk up to Rick&#39;s house. Tex and Katie break in through the front, while Sadie goes in through the side. Cliff sees them, but because he is tripping balls, he is neither frightened nor absolutely certain of what he is seeing. Even as Tex draws his gun on Cliff, he instead sics Brandy on Tex, who viciously chomps into Tex&#39;s arm and groin. Sadie tries to run up to Cliff with her knife, but he chucks a can of dog food at her, which smashes into her face. Cliff stomps Tex&#39;s face in before grabbing Sadie and brutally smashing her face against the hard furniture until she is dead. Brandy gets a few bites into Sadie as well, but she runs out flailing and shrieking into the pool, where Rick is lounging. He then comes out with his FLAMETHROWER and torches Sadie, who burns to death in his pool. In the chaos, Cliff gets shot, but non-fatally.<br/><br/>Paramedics and police arrive at the scene. Cliff is taken to the hospital for his injuries, while Francesca is freaked out by the ordeal. After Rick says bye to Cliff, he sees Jay calling to him from Sharon&#39;s gate. Rick explains what happened, and Jay recognizes Rick from TV. Jay tells Sharon who her neighbor is, and they invite him to come over for a drink. Rick agrees, and he finally meets Sharon and her friends.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Rick Dalton', 'Cliff Booth', 'Sharon Tate', 'Jay Sebring', 'Pussycat', 'James Stacy', 'Tex', 'Squeaky Fromme', 'Bruce Lee', 'Wayne Maunder', 'Marvin Schwarz', 'Sam Wanamaker']"

But his fun filled trip is suddenly sabotaged when a string of mysterious attacks by creatures called Elementals start wreaking havoc all over the world. To make matters more difficult, Peter finds himself recruited by Nick Fury and an interdimensional newcomer named Quentin Beck/Mysterio to help fight them and uncover the truth behind the attacks. Are the Elementals real?

Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) have arrived to investigate the area after a reported cyclone &quot;with a face&quot; had torn through the city. Moments later, the two encounter a being known as an Elemental, specifically the one that can manipulate earth. Fury and Maria are met by a man in a super-powered suit named Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), and he helps the two fight the Earth Elemental.<br/><br/>Cut to Midtown School of Science and Technology where Betty Brant (Angourie Rice) and Jason Ionello (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr) are doing their daily school news report, but they start with an &quot;In Memoriam&quot; dedicated to Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Vision. Betty recaps the events of The Snap (or &quot;The Blip&quot;, as it is called here from &#39;Avengers: Endgame&#39;), with many students having been dusted away before returning to life and finding that some of their younger classmates have now surpassed them physically.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tom Holland) discusses with Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) his plans to win over Michelle Jones/MJ (Zendaya), on whom he has developed a crush. They are prepping for a class trip to Europe, and Peter hopes that he can tell her how he feels.<br/><br/>Peter later attends a fundraiser as Spider-Man, with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) there to support him (and we learn that she got &quot;blipped&quot; too). They are met by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who appears to be flirting with May. He gives Peter a heads-up that Fury is going to call him, which he does almost instantly, but Peter ignores him since he has other things to worry about. He returns outside as Spidey to talk to reporters, but they overwhelm him with questions about becoming the new Iron Man or the next lead Avenger, so he leaves.<br/><br/>The class later heads out for the trip, with Peter choosing to leave the Spidey suit behind to enjoy his vacation, but he later finds that May packed it for him anyway. They are chaperoned by Mr. Harrington (Martin Starr) and Mr. Dell (J.B. Smoove), and are joined by other students, including Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), who is still a big Spidey fan but also still dumps on Peter. On the plane, Peter tries to get Ned to help him switch seats so that he can sit with MJ, but Ned only causes Mr. Harrington to take Peter while MJ is seated next to Brad Davis (Remy Hii), who is one of the kids that didn&#39;t get dusted and grew into a handsome athletic superstar. Peter is clearly jealous, while Ned sits next to Betty, and they end up becoming a couple.<br/><br/>The class arrives in Venice, Italy for their first stop. They stay in a crummy hotel, but they take time to enjoy the sights, while Peter tries to get closer to MJ. Suddenly, the water levels on the ground start rising. Soon, a massive Water Elemental begins to wreak havoc upon the city, using water to flood the city or destroy buildings. Peter tries to do something about it, but he left his Spidey suit at the hotel. Beck arrives and uses his powers to fight the Water Elemental. He is able to subdue the creature&#39;s attacks before ultimately splitting the creature in two. He is seen as a hero by Peter&#39;s classmates, and after watching a news report on him, they start to call him &quot;Mysterio&quot;.<br/><br/>Peter and Ned go back to their room, but Ned gets tranquilized by Fury. He has been trying to get Peter&#39;s attention, and it hasn&#39;t worked until now. They have to leave the room to talk in private since everyone keeps interrupting them. Fury takes Peter to his secret hideout to meet Maria and Beck. Beck explains that he is from an alternate Earth, which is where the Elementals are coming from. This was supposedly caused by The Snap, and Beck claims that the Fire Elemental was the one that destroyed his home world and his family. Fury wants Peter&#39;s help in fighting back, but he feels he isn&#39;t the Avenger that is qualified to fight beings like these.<br/><br/>Fury hijacks the class&#39;s vacation by having his employee, Dimitri (Numan Acar), act as a driver to their new and unexpected destination, Prague, as Fury and Beck have learned that&#39;s where the Fire Elemental is set to strike. Before heading out, Peter is taken by a tall woman sent by Fury to give him a stealth suit. She orders him to take off his clothes and put it on, but he is found by Brad, who takes a pic of Peter in what looks like a compromising position. Peter runs after him to get rid of the pic, but Brad says he knows that Peter likes MJ too, and he thinks showing her this will make her lean more toward Brad. On their trip, Peter finds Tony&#39;s high-tech glasses, EDITH (voice of Dawn Michelle King) (stands for &quot;Even Dead, I&#39;m The Hero&quot;), which Tony left for his successor. Peter asks EDITH to handle Brad, which is misinterpreted as a request for an attack. Peter has to (somewhat) discreetly stop the incoming drone from killing Brad, as well as the whole class. He just has EDITH hack into Brad&#39;s phone and delete the picture.<br/><br/>After arriving in Prague, Mr. Harrington tells the students that they were given tickets to the opera, which ruins their plans to go to the carnival, but it was planned by Fury to keep Peter&#39;s friends inside to avoid being caught in the path of the Fire Elemental. Peter is forced to stay outside and be on the lookout, which ruins HIS plan to sit next to MJ. She follows him outside, and Ned and Betty follow since they think the other two are headed for the carnival. Outside, the Fire Elemental emerges and begins to rampage. Spidey and Mysterio team up against the beast, trying to avoid letting it touch metal, or else it will get more powerful. Ned and Betty are trapped on the Ferris wheel as Spidey tries to save them, while Mysterio fights the Fire Elemental. Spidey fires a web at the beast, which pulls something out of it and makes it land near a hidden MJ. Mysterio then uses his powers to dive into the Fire Elemental&#39;s chest and destroy it. Peter goes down to make sure he is okay. However, he still gets chewed out by Fury for not doing what he told him to.<br/><br/>As the gang moves to Berlin, Peter and Beck are called by Fury and Maria to discuss forming a new team. Peter privately meets with Beck, and Peter thinks that Beck is the one that truly deserves EDITH, since he thinks Tony only left it for him to choose who is worthy of succeeding Iron Man. After Peter leaves, Beck takes down what has been a whole illusion in a dilapidated building. Everyone there works for him, and they are all disgruntled former employees of Stark Industries. Beck has been making up the Elementals to get people to see him as the hero, using drones to create the destruction left behind by their appearances. He and everyone there have been pissed at Tony for stealing their work, his Binary Augmented Retro Framing (BARF), and they have all worked together to get people to forget about Iron Man or Spider-Man, and to make way for Mysterio.<br/><br/>Peter goes back to the hotel to invite MJ to go out with him without anybody else. As he tries to tell her how he feels, she cuts him off to reveal she knows he&#39;s Spider-Man, due to the many &quot;coincidences&quot; involving them being in the same places at the same time. She then pulls out what she found at the site of the Fire Elemental fight, a projector that shows Mysterio fighting the as-yet-unseen Air Elemental. The two realize that Beck is behind the Elementals and that he is a fraud. As Beck and his goons prepare for the Air Elemental &quot;Avengers level&quot; attack, they find that the missing projector from one of their drones is in Peter&#39;s hands.<br/><br/>Peter goes to meet with Fury and Maria about Beck&#39;s true motives, but it turns out Beck has caught up to Peter first and has created an entire illusion to trap him in. He taunts Peter for not being the hero he wants to be, and even forces him to endure a projection of Tony bursting from his grave and coming out to terrorize him. It appears as though Fury subdues Beck and asks Peter who else he told about Beck, and he admits that he told MJ, Ned, and that Ned probably told Betty. This turns out to be another one of Beck&#39;s tricks, and now he knows to kill Peter&#39;s friends. He also puts Peter in the path of a train, which appears to strike him, but Peter is merely hurt really bad, and he passes out on the train.<br/><br/>Peter wakes up in a jail cell in the Netherlands. After breaking out, he calls Happy to come get him. While Happy tends to his wounds, Peter breaks down and says that he doesn&#39;t get why Tony would pick him as a successor when he keeps screwing everything up. Happy reassures him that Tony believed in him for a reason, and that he knew Peter would be the hero he needs to be. Peter picks himself up and goes to create himself a new suit from Tony&#39;s computer before they head to London to rescue his friends.<br/><br/>The class is taking a tour bus ride around London, but it&#39;s driven by one of Beck&#39;s goons. They stop on the London Bridge as Mysterio gets the Air Elemental ready to attack. Spidey shows up in a new suit for battle. Happy goes to get Ned, MJ, Betty, and Flash, but his jet gets blown up and they have to hide in a medieval tower as the drones go after them. They hide in a room, but MJ manages to knock down a drone with a mace before having to stay locked in a room. Spidey enters the illusion of the Air Elemental and webs all the drones together to get them to crash and break the illusion. He proceeds to destroy more drones before Mysterio has him cornered and faces a horde of drones directed at him while under an illusion. Using his Spider-Sense, Spidey dodges all the drones, destroys them all, and in the chaos, one of them shoots Mysterio. Peter goes to get EDITH, but Beck attempts one last illusion to kill him, and it fails, leaving Beck to die in disgrace. Peter then disables all the drones. Afterwards, he and MJ run onto the bridge to meet with each other. They acknowledge their mutual feelings, and they kiss. Fury tries to get Peter again, but Happy tells him to leave the kid alone since he&#39;s with his new girlfriend.<br/><br/>The students return home. Peter sits Happy and May down to discuss their apparently developing relationship, but while Happy thinks they are an item, May thinks they just had a fling. Peter then goes out to meet MJ for a date as Spidey. He takes her for a swing around the city, although the heights freak her out.<br/><br/>Mid-Credits: After their &quot;date&quot;, Spidey drops MJ off in the streets. They then overhear a breaking news broadcast in the middle of the city. Apparently, Beck recorded a video before his death and sent it to the Daily Bugle. It is shown by none other than the ruthless and antagonistic chief editor J. Jonah Jameson (played by none other than J.K. Simmons), and what plays is a doctored video done by Beck to make people think Spider-Man orchestrated the drone attacks on London. Beck then outs Spidey as Peter Parker to the whole city, leaving New Yorkers in disbelief over their hero, and putting Peter in a very troubling position...<br/><br/>Post-Credits: Fury and Maria are revealed to have been the Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his wife Soren (Sharon Blynn). They were ordered by Fury to give EDITH to Peter, and Talos gives Fury an update on what had just happened. Fury is then shown to be relaxing on a Skrull ship, which he is apparently commandeering.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Peter Parker', 'Spider', 'Nick Fury', 'Quentin Beck', 'Mysterio', 'May Parker', 'Happy Hogan', 'MJ', 'Ned Leeds', 'Flash Thompson', 'Betty Brant', 'Brad Davis', 'Mr', 'Mr', 'Maria Hill', 'Dimitri']"

Woody and the other toys mount a successful rescue operation, but while they are busy, a mysterious man buys Bo Peep; despite Woody&#39;s efforts to prevent the sale, Bo reassures him that it is part of being a toy to be taken away.<br/><br/>Two years after Andy donated his toys to Bonnie, Woody and the other toys are content in their new life. Worried that Bonnie will feel overwhelmed at her kindergarten orientation, Woody - who Bonnie has been neglecting - sneaks into her backpack, and his fears come to light as Bonnie becomes shy around her new classmates. Woody covertly places a spork and other items from a trash can on Bonnie&#39;s table during arts and crafts, and she turns them into a handmade toy-spork she names &quot;Forky&quot;. After Bonnie places Forky in her backpack, he comes to life, much to Woody&#39;s shock.<br/><br/>After Woody introduces him to the rest of Bonnie&#39;s toys, Forky experiences an existential crisis, believing that he was made to be trash and not a toy, and the other toys prevent him from throwing himself away. On a road trip with Bonnie&#39;s family and her toys, Forky - still believing himself to be trash - jumps out of the window, prompting Woody to go after him. Woody convinces Forky of the joys of being a toy, and they journey to the RV park where Bonnie and her parents will be staying.<br/><br/>Reaching the town, Woody spots Bo&#39;s lamp at an Antique Store. Searching for Bo inside, he and Forky encounter a doll named Gabby Gabby and her sycophant puppets, the Bensons. Gabby Gabby offers to take them to Bo, but soon reveals her true plan to obtain Woody&#39;s voice box, since her own is broken and no child will purchase her. When Bonnie and her parents enter the store, Woody and Forky try to escape, but Forky is captured by Gabby Gabby. By the time Woody escapes the shop, Bonnie&#39;s RV has left without him, and he realizes that he has left Forky behind. Woody reunites with Bo, who has become a nomad adventurer helping lost toys find owners. With Bo&#39;s companion, a miniature cop named Giggles McDimples, they take a route through a nearby carnival to rescue Forky from the antique store.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Buzz searches for Woody on his own, seeking guidance in the button-induced phrases from his own voice box. Buzz finds himself as a prize in a carnival booth and escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny. Buzz finds Woody and Bo, and they recruit Ducky and Bunny to help rescue Forky, promising that they will become Bonnie&#39;s toys, along with Bo&#39;s old friend from the antique store, Duke Caboom, a Canadian stuntman toy.<br/><br/>At the antique store, the toys&#39; plan to rescue Forky fails. Woody, the only toy still determined to save Forky, has a falling out with the other toys, and indirectly insults Bo. As Bo, Duke, Giggles, Ducky, and Bunny return to the carnival, Woody gives up his voice box to Gabby Gabby in exchange for Forky. Gabby Gabby is desperate to be adopted by Margaret (the store owner)&#39;s granddaughter, Harmony, but Harmony is creeped out by Gabby Gabby&#39;s new voice and rejects her. Buzz returns to Bonnie&#39;s RV and cries out to retrieve Bonnie&#39;s backpack, which she left at the antique store. Woody comforts Gabby Gabby, and Bo and her gang return after a change of heart.<br/><br/>After Bonnie returns for her backpack, the toys follow her and her parents. Through Duke&#39;s motorcycle skills, Buzz and Forky make it back to Bonnie, who is overjoyed to have Forky back.

However, on the night Jack decides to give up, the whole world is momentarily hit with a massive blackout during which Jack is hit by a bus. Upon regaining consciousness, Jack learns to his astonishment that he is apparently now the only one who knows the music of the Beatles. Realizing this improbable opportunity, Jack begins playing the music of the greatest of the rock bands, claiming it as his own. It pays off quickly and Jack becomes a worldwide musical sensation. However, Jack finds himself drifting away from Ellie, only realizing his love for her when she has become intimidated by his success, which depends on a blatant plagiarization that no one could find out.

He has been aspiring to reach musical success for a while now, with very little luck. Jack also works a part-time job at a superstore, but for him, it&#39;s a dead end. His manager and best friend, Ellie Appleton (Lily James), books him a gig at a music festival in a tent.<br/><br/>The gig ends up being in a small tent, with very few people actually paying any mind to Jack&#39;s music, other than Ellie and their friends Nick (Harry Michell), Carol (Sophia Di Martino), and Lucy (Ellise Chappell). There, he finds his bumbling friend Rocky (Joel Fry) there working, but he is high as hell. It gets to the point where Rocky screws up too much and gets fired. Jack expresses his disappointment over his failures to Ellie, thinking that if he hasn&#39;t reached the big time now, then he never will. He goes home later that night on his bike, when all of a sudden, the entire planet experiences a blackout. In the darkness, a bus hits Jack, sending him flying and hitting the pavement.<br/><br/>Jack wakes up in the hospital to find Ellie next to him. He is okay, but his two front teeth have been knocked out. Ellie later takes Jack to Nick and Carol&#39;s home, where Rocky is staying for the time being. Ellie gifts Jack with a new guitar since his other one got wrecked in the accident. He starts to play the song &quot;Yesterday&quot;. Everyone thinks it&#39;s beautiful and that he wrote it, but he says it was written by Paul McCartney. The only answer he gets is, &quot;Who?&quot; Jack insists that The Beatles wrote the song and that it&#39;s one of the greatest songs ever written, but they just assume he&#39;s being cocky. Afterward, Ellie drives Jack home, but he opts to take a bus ride home, as he is very confused. He goes home and looks The Beatles up on Google, but only gets results for the insect. Nothing even comes up on the John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Jack looks through his record collection and doesn&#39;t find a single Beatles album. He also discovers that, for some reason, the band Oasis doesn&#39;t exist either (and, as he later finds out, neither does Coca-Cola soda, cigarettes, and Harry Potter books and films in this strange alternate reality). He runs to Ellie&#39;s home in the pouring rain to ask if she really doesn&#39;t know who The Beatles are.<br/><br/>Jack finds himself in a conundrum, as he remembers all the Beatles songs, but worries that he would be doing something wrong by making it sound like he wrote them. Nevertheless, he makes notes and columns on every song of his that he knows all the lyrics to. He starts to write them down, with the hopes of having others hear it. He attempts to play &quot;Let It Be&quot; for his parents Jed (Sanjeev Bhaskar) and Sheila (Meera Syal), but Jack keeps getting interrupted when their annoying friend Terry (Karl Theobald) comes over and makes unsubtle quips about Jack&#39;s musical failures.<br/><br/>After several unsuccessful shows, Jack gets the attention of a recording producer named Gavin (Alexander Arnold), who loves what he&#39;s heard. He invites Jack and Ellie to record some songs. Jack performs &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; with Ellie singing backup. He then records a few more songs, which start to get radio play. This gets the attention of none other than Ed Sheeran. He calls Jack, but he assumes it&#39;s a prank. Ed then shows up to the Malik house and personally speaks to Jack about being his opening act when he tours around the States. Jack is honored and he accepts. His friends later throw a party for him, but the mood is dampened when Ellie is in his room and sees she&#39;s featured on the column of &quot;good chums&quot; and not the column of love songs. Jack realizes Ellie admitted she&#39;s in love with him, but he tries his best to avoid discussing it any further by returning to the party.<br/><br/>Jack joins Ed on their tour, accompanied by Rocky as a roadie. During one show in Moscow, a man, Leo (Justin Edwards), listens to Jack&#39;s music and has a bewildered look on his face before he goes home to look up Jack&#39;s album to see the songs he has.<br/><br/>Jack and Ed spend a lot of time together, and Ed even challenges him to create a new song to play to an audience. Ed does his, and Jack sings &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. Ed admits that Jack is way better than he is, although Jack doesn&#39;t want to take that credit. After playing a couple more Beatles songs, Jack is approached by Ed&#39;s manager, Debra Hammer (Kate McKinnon). She offers to sign Jack to her label, but is super blunt about how the label will acquire most of the money he makes, and also how Jack REALLY needs to change his doughy, unkempt appearance if he wants to maintain some kind of image.<br/><br/>Jack&#39;s star rises quickly after signing under Debra. He and Rocky get chased through the streets by rabid fans, and his music becomes a worldwide phenomenon. However, Jack continues to feel pressure to put out as much Beatles material as he can. He even dreams that he is on James Corden&#39;s show and is confronted by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr over his plagiarism. He tries to record one of his own personal songs, &quot;Summer Song&quot; (a favorite among his friends), but Debra hates it.<br/><br/>During a meeting with his marketing team, the head of the team (Lamorne Morris) addresses the titles of Jack&#39;s albums (Sgt Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band and The White Album), since they are confusing to their audience, so they decide to call it &quot;The One and Only&quot;, implying that only Jack is responsible for the songs, which just makes him feel more guilty.<br/><br/>Jack can&#39;t remember the lyrics to &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, so he and Rocky travel to Liverpool for inspiration by visiting the sites that the songs are named after. A woman named Liz (Sarah Lancashire) spots the two at the sites and watches them suspiciously.<br/><br/>While in England, Jack is visited by Ellie. The two later go to his room and start to kiss, but Ellie feels awkward about it since they are giving in to their mutual feelings at the height of Jack&#39;s newfound success. The next day, he tries to catch her as she heads back, right before he and Rocky need to return to L.A., and he finds her in a train station restaurant. Although Jack tries to talk to her, Ellie says that she has waited for too long for Jack to love her back. He joins Rocky on the trip back.<br/><br/>Jack returns to keep performing. He later receives a call from Ellie, saying she has started seeing Gavin, and she wanted to let him know before he found out from someone else. She and Gavin, plus her and Jack&#39;s friends, all show up at a huge beach show to see him play &quot;Help!&quot;, although Ellie sees that he&#39;s not just singing it. Later, Rocky tells Jack that he has two visitors. It&#39;s Leo and Liz. It turns out they are the only other two people besides Jack who still remember The Beatles, but since they can&#39;t sing, they are thankful for keeping their music alive. Although they have a few criticisms, in particular, Jack forgetting some lyrics and also turning &quot;Hey Jude&quot; into &quot;Hey Dude&quot; (that&#39;s Ed and Debra&#39;s fault), they all agree that a world without The Beatles is worse off. Liz also helps Jack with one other thing.<br/><br/>Jack takes an address from Liz and directed to the home of none other than the still-living John Lennon (Robert Carlyle). Since Lennon is not a musician/composer in this alternate world, he has been able to live to age 78 and had spent a lovely life with his wife Cynthia and their children. Jack asks if he wished things turned out differently, but John assures him that he had everything he needed, and that was enough for him. Jack asks to hug Lennon, and although he thinks he&#39;s a weirdo, he allows it.<br/><br/>At Wembley, Jack performs another show, but he gets help from Ed and Rocky. He has them bring Ellie backstage at the end of the show, and they put the camera on her. In front of the whole audience, as well as Debra, Jack not only confesses his feelings for Ellie (which she hears), but also that the songs were written by The Beatles. He no longer wants to take credit for the songs or receive any money for it, so he has Rocky upload all of the songs online for free. He leaves the stage to go meet with Ellie, who is stunned by what she heard. Gavin also heard it, but he isn&#39;t mad since he knew he wasn&#39;t going to match up to Jack (but he later ends up with Lucy). Fans, plus an enraged Debra, chase after Jack, but he flees with Ellie while Rocky holds everyone back. Jack and Ellie go home and make love for the first time.<br/><br/>Later on, Jack is seen at a school teaching kids other Beatles songs, and they sing &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;. It is played over a montage of Jack and Ellie getting married and having a son and daughter. Even with his fame gone, Jack has found a greater success in his personal life.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Jack Malik', 'Ellie Appleton', 'Rocky']"

Billi maintains a close relationship with her paternal grandmother - her &quot;Nai Nai&quot; - back in Changchun via the occasional visit and frequent telephone calls. As is Chinese custom, Billi and Nai Nai tell each other little white lies both to save face and to prevent the other from worrying about the painful truth. Those little white lies turn into one big lie when Haiyan and his older brother Haibin, who emigrated to Japan years ago, learn that Nai Nai has just been diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer with the prognosis of only months to live, the diagnosis and prognosis which they and the rest of their extended family that know decide to keep from Nai Nai herself.

Billi gets a call from Nai Nai in the morning in NYC and gets fussed over like all grandmas do over their grand kids. What Nai Nai doesn&#39;t tell her is, she&#39;s in the hospital for some tests accompanied by her sister, Little Nai Nai (Hong Lu). They agree they&#39;ll talk later and Nai Nai goes for a CT scan. Her sister goes to talk to the doctor afterwards and then tells Nai Nai there&#39;s nothing wrong, just &quot;some benign shadows.&quot;<br/><br/>Billi is not really doing well in her life, and while on the phone with Nai Nai later on that day, she opens a letter that says her application for a Guggenheim fellowship has been rejected. She keeps this information from Nai Nai and everybody else.<br/><br/>Billi goes to visit her parents and her mom gives her grief over the fact she doesn&#39;t have any money or seems to be moving forward with her life. She also tells her she and Haiyan are leaving for China the next day because their nephew Hao Hao is getting married to Aiko (who is Japanese and doesn&#39;t speak Chinese) and Billi is not to accompany them. When Billi questions why the wedding is so rushed, Jian hushes her as Hayan is sleeping. Billi asks why, since it&#39;s only 6:00PM, but Jian waves her off.<br/><br/>Billi then goes in the bedroom where her father is sitting on the bed. She asks what&#39;s wrong because she can tell something is not right, and questions whether he&#39;s been drinking, which he denies. Hayan eventually tells her Nai Nai has stage four lung cancer and the wedding is just an excuse for everybody to go over there and see her. Billi says she must go, but her parents refuse. Jian says they&#39;re not telling Nai Nai about her condition because in China families believe if you tell someone they have cancer, they die, not because of the disease but of the fear. The reason they don&#39;t want her to go is, Billi&#39;s emotions show on her face and Nai Nai will know something is wrong.<br/><br/>Billi eventually shows up in China, much to her parents&#39; dismay and Nai Nai&#39;s delight. Jian questions once again where Billi got the money for the plane ticket, but Billi doesn&#39;t reply, and shows her instead she can hide her feelings. From then on, it&#39;s all about the wedding planning and the differences between America and China, with Jian and YuPing (a distant relative) sniping back and forth about life opportunities in the two countries. Nai Nai cuts the arguments short by saying they can&#39;t criticize China, no matter what.<br/><br/>Nai Nai teaches Billi some form of walking/breathing exercise that involves grunting out loud &quot;so you can do it alone when you go back to America.&quot; Billi struggles with the &quot;we&#39;re not telling Nai Nai she has cancer&quot; thing and keeps bringing it up, only to be shut down again and again. Eventually, after an evening of heavy drinking by the immediate family, Nai Nai goes to the hospital after a coughing attack. Once again, Billy brings up with the doctor the situation with Nai Nai, and he also advises against telling her about her condition. He tells Nai Nai the cough is leftover from the pneumonia she&#39;d had earlier in the year and it&#39;s a secondary infection. He agrees to change her medicine and orders an X-ray.<br/><br/>Billi finds her father and uncle Haibin (Yongbo Jiang) smoking at the hotel where they&#39;re all staying, and she brings up the lying again. Haibin explains that the difference between living in America and in China is that in America people believe their life belong to themselves, whereas in China people&#39;s lives are part of a whole, of a family, of society, and therefore it is the family&#39;s duty to carry the emotional burden of the cancer knowledge FOR Nai Nai.<br/><br/>Billi tells her mother she wants to stay in China to take care of Nai Nai but Jian is not having it and once again berates her daughter since she &quot;can&#39;t cook, can&#39;t clean, what are you going to do?&quot; Billi brings up she couldn&#39;t come to China when her grandpa (Ye Ye in Mandarin) died and how that affected her. Jian once again dismisses her.<br/><br/>Before the wedding, Nai Nai asks Billi to be nice and courteous with the wedding guests, smiling and greeting them and agreeing to sing if called to do so. On the wedding day, after arguing with her sister for having to wait until Monday for her X-ray results, Nai Nai gets Billi&#39;s attention and gestures for her to smile, so Billi does what she&#39;s been asked to do and is nice to everybody. However, at the time of the speeches, Haibin, father of the groom, goes up on stage and basically loses it and starts crying which he attributes to being &quot;very happy.&quot; Billi also goes up on stage and makes a speech, aided by her dad who tells her the Mandarin Chinese for &quot;congratulations.&quot; They also do karaoke together to &quot;Killing Me Softly.&quot; After a raucous drinking game, Hao Hao starts crying inconsolably.<br/><br/>When the time comes for the family picture with the bride and groom, Nai Nai questions why the groom is crying and once again she&#39;s told &quot;tears of joy.&quot; Little Nai Nai asks if they can take one with her camera, which Nai Nai says she gave to Mrs Gao (their maid) to hold. When Little Nai Nai asks where Mrs Gao is, Nai Nai says she sent her to the hospital to get the X-ray results.<br/><br/>As soon as the picture is taken, Billi hightails it to the hospital to intercept Mrs Gao, which he does, only to realize Mrs Gao is illiterate and doesn&#39;t know what the test results are. Then Billi and Little Nai Nai take the results to a shop to have them altered to read &quot;benign shadows.&quot; When the shop employee questions what that means, Little Nai Nai snaps, &quot;It&#39;s not terminal!&quot;<br/><br/>Nai Nai gets the test results and tells them all off, &quot;you worried for nothing! I told you I was fine!&quot; After that, she meets with Billi before she leaves and gives her an envelope with money, because she&#39;d given one to Hao Hao so Billi gets one too. When Billi opposes, as she didn&#39;t get married, Nai Nai says that&#39;s more the reason for her to accept it, and to not spend it on something sensible like the rent, but to get herself something nice. Billi then confesses to Nai Nai she missed out on the fellowship, and Nai Nai advises that it&#39;s not so much what you do in life, but the way you do it.<br/><br/>Billi and her parents are leaving and Nai Nai hugs Billi for the longest time before letting her go and assuring her they&#39;ll see each other again. Billi is back in New York City, unsure of what to do, and while walking down the street, she stops in her tracks and grunts loudly, like Nai Nai taught her. The movie ends.<br/><br/>We&#39;re shown a video of the actual Nai Nai, who&#39;s still going strong six years after her stage four cancer diagnosis.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Billi', 'Jian', 'Aiko', 'Hao Hao']"

Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario) competes, but she just misses the best time. It brings back a memory of her losing a relay as a child and feeling bad, but her father Dave (Barry Pepper) would continue to encourage her to keep up her hard work.<br/><br/>After the relay, she receives a video call from her sister Beth (Moryfydd Clark). She informs Haley about the impending category 5 Hurricane Wendy that is about to strike Florida. Beth expresses concern since she hasn&#39;t heard from their father, and she thinks he is still around the area. They have a slight argument since it appears that Haley took Dave&#39;s side in her parents&#39; divorce, while Beth took their mother&#39;s side. Beth just asks that Haley get in touch with Dave.<br/><br/>Haley starts to drive out of town as per evacuation notices, trying and failing to get in touch with Dave. She runs into an old friend/ex-boyfriend of Beth&#39;s named Wayne (Ross Anderson), who is attempting to direct traffic as the storm starts to hit. He shows her where to go, but, out of concern for her father, Haley turns around and drives down a path to get back to find Dave.<br/><br/>Haley goes to Dave&#39;s condo to only find his dog Sugar there. The rest of the place is empty. Haley calls Beth to inform her, and Haley suggests that Dave is at their old family home. Haley heads there with Sugar against Beth&#39;s wishes, especially as the streets have started to fill up with water. When they get to the house, Haley doesn&#39;t find anyone upstairs. She calls his phone and finds it in the kitchen. His car is still in the garage. Alerted by Sugar&#39;s barking, Haley goes into the basement where she finds Dave unconscious and with a badly broken leg. She tries to carry him upstairs, but they are attacked by an alligator that has made its way down there. Haley pulls herself and Dave to safety before barricading themselves behind pipes.<br/><br/>Haley tries to help tend to Dave&#39;s wounds, but he tells her she should get out of there on her own. She refuses to leave without him. Dave explains that his leg got broken after escaping the gator. Haley wants to retrieve her phone that she dropped in the struggle, so she attempts to get through by staying hidden. She reaches it, but a second gator appears behind her. While trying to escape both gators, one of them crushes the phone. Haley&#39;s leg gets bitten, but she manages to blind one of the gators in one eye, while Dave beats the other gator&#39;s head in. She gets away from both of them and stays in a corner to treat her wound. Dave also painfully manages to fix his leg.<br/><br/>With the water levels in the basement quickly rising, Haley tries to find a way to get help. She flashes a light to two people, Stan (Ansom Boom) and Lee (Ami Metcalf), who are across the street at the gas station trying to loot it with their friend Marv (George Somner). Stan starts walking over, but the gators get Lee in the boat before getting to Stan. He tries to yell out to Marv to warn him, but Marv watches as Stan is messily torn up outside the store. Marv sees too late in the mirror that a gator has come for him, and it immediately makes a meal out of him.<br/><br/>Dave suggests that the only other way out is through a passage leading up back to the living room, as taking the stairs will lead to the gators. Haley tries to push the hatch open, but it is blocked by a drawer weighing it down. Outside, Haley and Dave notice Wayne and his police partner Pete (Jose Palma) coming by to check for people who may have been left behind. Pete stays on the boat while Wayne goes inside. Pete notices that the boat&#39;s turbine is caught in seaweed. Wayne enters the house to try and find Haley, but he is grabbed by a gator&#39;s jaws. Pete is caught outside by another gator as well, and he is brutally torn to shreds by other gators joining in. Haley makes it to Dave&#39;s side and begins to cry, thinking they will die right there. She also has been blaming herself for her parents&#39; divorce, thinking that she made Dave turn his priorities toward her and swimming. He assures her that none of it is her fault and that she and Beth kept them together until they both moved out. Dave encourages Haley to keep pushing forward.<br/><br/>Haley goes for Wayne&#39;s gun, but a gator bites into her arm. She shoots repeatedly until it is finally dead, and the bullets have run out. Haley then figures the only other way out is through the storm drain, which is where the gators came in from. She swims through it and avoids being spotted by the gators, but she does see that they have already laid eggs, and some of them are hatching. She gets out safely and runs into the house to pry the hatch door open with a crowbar, just as the basement has completely filled with water. Haley pulls Dave out, but he is unconscious. She manages to revive him, and they make their way outside.<br/><br/>Haley and Dave grab Sugar and attempt to make their way to the looters&#39; boat across the street, but they want to do so without making splashes so that the gators won&#39;t hear them. They are successful in getting the boat, but the flood waters become too much, and it pushes the boat back into the house. Haley finds a radio and tries to call for help. Dave tries to protect Sugar from a gator, and he gets his arm bitten off. Haley is trapped in the upstairs bathroom with a gator as the water level rises in there, but she manages to trap it in the shower before getting back to Dave.<br/><br/>The two take Sugar outside as they head to higher ground. Another gator attempts to attack Haley, but it gets swept away by the current. She and Dave lay on the roof as a helicopter comes near. Using a road flare she found, Haley uses it to signal it toward them. It works, and the people in the helicopter lower something to pull them up to safety.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Haley', 'Dave']"

One day while roaming the streets, Aladdin spots a beautiful girl who gets in trouble after giving away bread to children without paying. Aladdin comes to her rescue, and together they get chased by the Royal Guards. After a while they elude their pursuers, and Aladdin takes the girl to his place for some tea. The girl calls herself Dalia, and is the handmaiden to the Princess of Agrabah. She suddenly has to leave as another suitor for the princess, Prince Anders, arrives. Dalia happens to be Princess Jasmine and Dalia is the name of her handmaid and best friend. Meanwhile, The Sultan&#39;s trusted councilor, Jafar, is plotting to overthrown the Sultan by getting his hands on the Magic Lamp. However, it is hidden in a enchanted Cave of Wonders, and only the &quot;Diamond in the Rough&quot; may enter, which he is not. So, he spends weeks searching for this Diamond in the Rough.<br/><br/>One evening, after turning down Prince Anders&#39; hand in marriage, Jasmine receives a surprise visit from Aladdin, who has come to return her mother&#39;s bracelet, which Abu stole. Still thinking she&#39;s Delia, he leaves her with a promise to meet her again, but is caught by the royal guards. The next day, Aladdin finds himself in the desert with Jafar, who assumes that he is the Diamond in the Rough. He tells Aladdin that the girl he met was the princess and that he can make him rich enough to impress her if he helps him retrieve the lamp. By evening, they arrive at the cave, and since Aladdin is the Diamond in the Rough he is permitted to enter the cave safely. The Cave of Wonders is filled with wondrous treasures that tempt both Aladdin and Abu. However, they have been warned to only retrieve the lamp and not to be tempted by the treasure otherwise they would be trapped inside the cave forever. Along the way they meet a Magic Carpet and find the lamp. However, Abu becomes tempted by a big shiny ruby and takes it. This angers the spirit of the cave, and starts to cave in. Aladdin and Abu barely make it back with Carpet&#39;s help, but end up trapped in the cave after Jafar takes the lamp and betrays him.<br/><br/>Trapped inside the cave, Abu reveals that he stole the lamp back from Jafar. Aladdin notices the lamp is a bit dusty and gives it a rub. This causes the lamp to release a powerful Genie who can grant him three wishes, as long as he is holding the lamp. Aladdin wishes to escape from the cave (though he makes a wish without holding the lamp, keeping his three wishes in tact), and both he, Genie, Abu and Carpet find themselves in the middle of the desert. After seeing Genie&#39;s potential, Aladdin wishes to become a prince in the hopes that he can be with Princess Jasmine. Genie transforms him into Prince Ali, and parade to The Sultan&#39;s Palace, where the Sultan welcomes him.<br/><br/>Aladdin starts off a bit awkward being a prince and trying to impress Jasmine, especially when Genie has him dance spectacularly in front of the princess. Instead of being impressed she just leaves. Meanwhile, Jafar becomes suspicious of Prince Ali.<br/><br/>Later, Aladdin decides to go and Jasmine in her room, while Genie takes Delia out for a late night stroll. By just being himself, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a magic carpet ride, where the two of them become close. While watching the village people from above, Jasmine figures out that Ali is Aladdin, but he manages to convince her that he is really a prince and that he dresses as a commoner to escape palace life. Then he takes Jasmine back to the palace and they share their first kiss.<br/><br/>The next day however, Jafar captures Aladdin, who has figured out who he really is. He threatens to have him thrown into bay unless he tells him where the lamp is. When Aladdin denies everything, Jafar personally pushes him out of his tower and falls into the sea. Abu and Carpet arrive with the lamp, and Aladdin manages to rub it before drowning. Genie rescues Aladdin, and after speaking with Jasmine they confront the Sultan of Jafar&#39;s treachery. Jafar tries to hypnotize the sultan into thinking they are lying, but Aladdin destroys his staff, proving to the sultan of Jafar&#39;s treachery. He is taken to the dungeon, but escapes after his parrot sidekick, Iago brings him the keys.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Sultan thanks Aladdin for revealing Jafar&#39;s treachery, and would be happy to have him marry his daughter. This makes Aladdin decide not to use his last wish to set Genie free as he promised, as he believes he cannot keep up being a prince without him. Genie is disappointed that Aladdin wants to continue living a lie and retreats to his lamp. Aladdin goes back to his old home in deep thought, and comes to see that Genie is right. He needs to tell Jasmine the truth. Just then, he realizes the lamp is gone and is now in Jafar&#39;s possession.<br/><br/>Jafar wishes to become sultan, but when the guards refuse to obey him he uses his second wish to become a sorcerer. He banishes Aladdin to the ends of the earth and threatens to kill Dalia and the Sultan unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. However, Genie sends carpet to find Aladdin and Abu.<br/><br/>As they proceed with the wedding ceremony, Jasmine notices Aladdin coming on carpet. She plays along with the wedding and once she gets close enough to Jafar, she swipes the lamp from him and jumps onto carpet. Jafar sends Iago after them, turning him into a giant parrot. They almost lose the lamp during the chase, but get it back. However, Iago steals it back, but then loses it when the Sultan interrupts Jafar&#39;s sorcery on him. He changes back into a regular parrot. However, Jafar then casts a sand twister that capture Aladdin and Jasmine and brings them back to him. Jafar now has them at his mercy, declaring him the most powerful man in the world. However, Aladdin retorts by claiming Jafar is not as powerful as he wishes to believe. The Genie remains the most powerful being in the universe as he gave Jafar his power in the first place and can also take it away. Realizing what Aladdin says is true and that he is still just &quot;second-best&quot;, Jafar uses his final wish to become an all-powerful genie. Seeing Aladdin&#39;s cunning plan, Genie grants his wish, turning Jafar into a monstrously powerful genie. With phenomenal, cosmic power at his command, Jafar declares himself ruler of the universe. However, as pointed out by Aladdin, the power of a genie comes with a price. Jafar receives his own golden shackles and a lamp prison, which sucks him inside along with Iago.<br/><br/>Foiled and trapped by his own greed, Jafar&#39;s magic over Agrabah is undone. As for Jafar&#39;s Lamp, Genie sends it flying to the Cave of Wonders, where the bickering Jafar and Iago would be forced to remain, as prisoners, for many years. Aladdin apologies to Jasmine and the Sultan for deceiving them, and is just about to leave until Genie reminds him that he has one wish left to make himself a prince again or erase the law of a prince marrying a princess. However, Aladdin decides to use last wish to set Genie free. Genie decides to spend his freedom seeing the world with Dalia, who he has fallen in love with, and have children together.<br/><br/>The Sultan has decided to pass his crown onto Jasmine, making her the Sultan of Agrabah.

The doll summons spirits to attack Ed as they drive to their home but he survives and Annabelle is placed in a sacred glass case in the couple&#39;s artifacts room and blessed by Father Gordon to ensure her evil is contained.<br/><br/>One year later, in 1972, the Warrens welcome Mary Ellen, who will be in charge of babysitting the couple&#39;s daughter, Judy, to their home when they go overnight to investigate another case. At school, Judy sees the spirit of a priest that begins following her. After shopping at her friend&#39;s supermarket and talking with her crush, Bob Palmeri, Mary Ellen starts to bake a cake for Judy&#39;s birthday. Her friend Daniela arrives uninvited to the Warrens&#39; home. Daniela, who is curious about speaking to the dead after the death of her father, gives a pair of roller skates to Judy as her birthday present and convinces her to play with Mary Ellen outside. While they are away, Daniela tries to get into the artifacts room but finds the room securely locked.<br/><br/>Daniela finds the door&#39;s key in the Warren&#39;s home office and starts exploring and touching artifacts, ultimately trying to contact her late father with an artifact called the Mourner&#39;s Bracelet. She accidentally leaves Annabelle&#39;s glass case unlocked after hearing a knock that makes her think that her father is attempting to communicate. The terror begins shortly afterward with a knock at the front, but there&#39;s no one there. The spirit of Bee Mullins interrupts Mary Ellen. That night, Annabelle begins releasing other spirits, such as the Ferryman, the Bride, cursed samurai armor, a Feeley Meeley board game, and a hellhound. After Bob arrives and asks Mary Ellen out on a date, he is attacked by the hellhound, and hides in the chicken coop in the Warrens&#39; backyard. Mary Ellen is attacked and dragged by the Ferryman, while Judy is confronted by Annabelle in her bedroom. When Daniela goes to return the artifacts room&#39;s key, she becomes trapped inside the room and tormented by a monkey toy and an old television that can predict the near future.<br/><br/>A future, bloody, and screaming Daniela appears on the television screen after having answered a cursed telephone. When the real Daniela reaches to answer the telephone, Judy and Mary Ellen, who have escaped from the spirits attacking them, rush in and prevent Daniela from doing so. The trio eventually escapes from the artifacts room after Annabelle terrorizes them again. Judy explains that they must lock Annabelle in her case again so the other spirits will rest. When they attempt to retrieve the doll, Daniela is attacked and possessed by the Bride and starts attacking Mary Ellen. Eventually, Mary Ellen and Judy find the doll after the priest&#39;s spirit, acting as Judy&#39;s guardian, shows them the way. Daniela recovers when Judy plays Ed&#39;s recorded footage of the Bride&#39;s exorcism and helps Mary Ellen and Judy recover the doll. They managed to retrieve the glass case&#39;s key after they are attacked by demonic hands from the Feeley Meeley board game. After the doll&#39;s case is locked, the disturbances stop and the other spirits return to their slumber. The trio is also reunited with Bob, who has survived the hellhound&#39;s attacks.<br/><br/>The next morning, Ed and Lorraine returns and the trio tell them about their struggles. Eventually Daniela apologizes to Lorraine, but Lorraine knows her ill-advised actions were the result of her wanting to contact her late father. Lorraine tells Daniela about a message she received from him, returning the picture of her father that Daniela had inserted in the bracelet earlier. The two then reunite with the others to join Judy&#39;s birthday party celebrations along with Judy&#39;s friends.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')","[]","['Lorraine Warren', 'Ed Warren', 'Judy Warren', 'Mary Ellen', 'Daniela Rios', 'Bob Palmeri', 'Bee', 'Cop', 'Father Gordon']"
