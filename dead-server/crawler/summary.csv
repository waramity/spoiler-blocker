Sivana is knocked off the roof, now mortal. Shazam grabs Sivana and drags him to the carnival, ripping the magical eye out. Saving the day, the Shazam family basks in the cheers of the crowd, takes the eye back to the lair, and return the sins for keeping. Shazam and Freddie decide this is their lair. Back at the foster home, everyone returned to their original form and are watching a news cast of the carnival instance, with Santa Claus describing the event. The foster family all talk and laugh and Billy finally feels happy and safe accepting a family.<br/><br/>At school, Freddie sits down at lunch and the entire table leaves so all his siblings come and sit next to him.

Inspired by real events, Billboard lifts the veil, on an inexperienced entrepreneur who will do anything to succeed.<br/><br/>Not your typical bombastic publicity stunt host, Casey Lindeweiler returns home to Allentown, Pennsylvania, after he inherits an AM radio station, WTYT 960, from his father. Upon Casey&#39;s arrival, he discovers that his dad was drowning in debt and the station is being kept alive by a small band of dedicated DJs who don&#39;t want to see the only independent radio station left in town fail.<br/><br/>Uncertain of what to do to boost ratings, Casey pulls out one of the oldest tricks in radio, the wacky contest. Casey&#39;s grand idea is to host a billboard-sitting contest where four people will live on a catwalk, in front of a billboard. Whoever lives up there the longest will win a mobile home and &quot;nine-sixty&quot; thousand dollars.<br/><br/>WTYT 960 becomes the laughing stock of the community. The mockery of Casey&#39;s contest drives awareness beyond the main stream to the fringes, stirring interest in the contest, much to the chagrin of his local radio market competition. As the contest begins, Casey&#39;s lack of preparation becomes apparent as he feels the weight of responsibility for the lives of his contestants. What he thought would last days, ends up lasting a lot, lot longer.<br/><br/>Over time, the contest begins to spiral out of Casey&#39;s control, causing him to dig deep within himself to uncover the true catalyst of what&#39;s driving him to save the station. Is his sheer determination enough? His competition mounts a smear campaign influencing the press and local authorities to turn against him just as Mother Nature takes a turn for the worse, inciting public demands that he put an end to the contest.<br/><br/>John Robinson (Elephant, Lords of Dogtown), Leo Fitzpatrick (Kids, Gotham), Independent Spirit Award winner Heather Matarazzo (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Princess Diaries) and Academy Awards nominee and Independent Spirit Award winner Eric Roberts (Cable Guy, Dark Knight) star in this truly independent film, about a maverick entrepreneur who attempts to overcome hurdle after hurdle as he fights to save his independence. Yet his success is in the hands of the media whose reporting of events affects the public&#39;s perception of his intentions, and ultimately, his fate.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')"

The circus has run into financial troubles and Medici has been forced to sell the circus&#39;s horses after Holt&#39;s wife and co-performer, Annie, passed away, so Medici reassigns Holt as the caretaker for the circus&#39;s pregnant elephant, Mrs. Jumbo.\nMrs. Jumbo gives birth to a calf with unusually large ears and Medici orders Holt to hide the ears before allowing the public to see the calf. However, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance and the crowd mockingly names the calf Dumbo while pelting him with peanuts and other objects. Mrs. Jumbo is distressed by her son&#39;s mistreatment and rampages into the ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally killing an abusive handler. Afterwards, to prevent a public relations problem, Medici results to selling Mrs. Jumbo. Holt&#39;s son and daughter, Joe and Milly Farrier, comfort Dumbo and realize he can fly by flapping his ears. The children also discover that feathers are the key to Dumbo&#39;s willingness to fly.\nIn another performance, Dumbo plays the role of a firefighter clown to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk, but the performance goes wrong and Dumbo is trapped on a high platform surrounded by flames. Milly risks her life to deliver a feather to Dumbo, giving him the confidence to fly. The audience is astounded when Dumbo flying and word of his talent begins to spread.\nV. A. Vandevere, the owner of Dreamland, a bohemian amusement park, approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration; Medici would become Vandevere&#39;s partner and the Medici Brothers&#39; Circus&#39;s troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland. Later, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with French trapeze artist, Colette Marchant.\nColette and Dumbo&#39;s debut performance at Dreamland goes wrong with Dumbo nearly falling off a high platform leading to him trumpeting in alarm since no net has been added to avoid possible injuries and fatalities. Dumbo hears his mother&#39;s call in response and realizes that his mother is an exhibit elsewhere in Dreamland. Dumbo flies out of the circus ring, reuniting with his mother.\nFearing that Dumbo&#39;s mother may become a distraction to him, Vandevere orders Mrs. Jumbo to be taken away and killed. Vandevere also fires all of the Medici performers from Dreamland. When Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn Vandevere intends to kill Dumbo&#39;s mother, they resolve to set both her and Dumbo free. The circus performers utilize their various talents to break Mrs. Jumbo out of her enclosure while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but accidentally starts a fire triggered by mismanagement of Dreamland&#39;s electricity system which spreads and destroys the park.\nAfter Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, Holt, Colette, the children, and the troupe bring Dumbo and his mother to the harbor, where they board a ship back to their native home. Afterwards, the renamed Medici circus is re-established (while it is implied that Vandevere is tried for arson through misconduct) and flourishes with Colette as the newest troupe member. Meanwhile, Dumbo and his mother reunite with a herd of wild elephants in the jungle.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')"

After Russell wins Adelaide a Thriller T-shirt at a carnival game and plays Whac-a-Mole, Adelaide wanders off and encounters a man with a Jeremiah 11:11 placard and then walks into a nearby fun-house. Inside, she&#39;s terrified by the mirrors and vibe of the place and eventually comes face to face with an exact doppelganger. The incident scares her. Some time later, Adelaide is refusing to talk as her parents worry about her. The therapist tells them to make Adelaide tell her story through the form of anything - reading, writing, or dance.<br/><br/>Many years later, an adult Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong&#39;o) goes on a beach trip with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and their two children Zora (Shahidi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). While the family has lunch at their beach house, we find out several things - one is that the beach trip was to help the children cope with the death of their grandmother and the other is that Adelaide appears to still be terrified of the idea of going to the beach because of what happened before and refuses to go. After some persuasion, however, she reluctantly agrees to join her family to go to the beach. On the way, the family sees a man being brought into an ambulance - it is the same man that Adelaide encountered many years ago with the Jeremiah 11:11 placard.<br/><br/>At the beach, the Wilson family meets their friend the Tylers, comprising of Kitty (Elizabeth Moss), Josh (Tim Heidecker), and their twin teenage daughters Gwen and Maggie (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). While the kids are all at the beach, Kitty and Adelaide talk about Adelaide&#39;s soft-spoken nature and her past as a young ballet dancer. Jason soon wanders off on his own and finds a man with his arms stretched out dripping with blood. Adelaide notices her son missing and panicking, eventually finds Jason and decides that it&#39;s time for the family to go back to the house.<br/><br/>Later that night, after the family settles down, Adelaide tells Gabe all about her childhood trauma and worries that recent events mean that her doppelganger is coming to get her. Gabe tells her not to worry... and almost instantly, the power goes off. As Gabe is about to run the backup generator, Jason alerts the family that there&#39;s a family in their driveway. Adelaide quickly calls 9-1-1 while Gabe attempts to scare the family off. Eventually, the family begins entering the Wilson&#39;s house, and one of the figures hits Gabe with a baseball bat while everyone else corners them in the living room.<br/><br/>Inside the living room, the Wilsons get a better look at the family... and it is all doppelgangers of themselves with their faces painted in red, wielding a pair of scissors. Adelaide&#39;s doppelganger tells them of a story of a princess and her shadow and their relationship, before forcing Adelaide to handcuff herself to the table. She then makes Zora run away from the house with her doppelganger in hot pursuit, makes Jason join his to play, and has Gabe&#39;s drag him off to a boat. (Note: for posterity&#39;s sake, although their names are never explicitly used, the doppelgangers are referred to by their names in the closing credits - Adelaide&#39;s is Red, Gabe&#39;s is Abraham, Jason&#39;s is Pluto, and Zora&#39;s is Umbrae.)<br/><br/>From this point on, we encounter the family dealing with their doubles in several ways.<br/><br/>After running far away, Zora thinks she&#39;s outrun her doppelganger Umbrae... only for her to appear on the top of a car. A neighbor spots the commotion and confronts them... but Umbrae murders him with her scissors while Zora escapes.<br/><br/>Abraham drags an unconscious Gabe all the way to the family&#39;s boat and then places him inside a bag. Gabe eventually awakens and successfully throws Abraham overboard. Later on, however, the boat engine fails, and Gabe falls in the water. He ultimately makes his way back to the boat... only for Abraham to emerge and grab him. After a fight, Gabe manages to turn on the boat&#39;s engine in time, completely eviscerating Abraham.<br/><br/>Back at the house, Jason leads Pluto inside a closet and notices that he mirrors his actions almost simultaneously. He takes off his mask and finds that half of Pluto&#39;s face is burned off. Jason impresses him with a magic trick, but when Pluto demands that he do the trick again, he successfully traps him in the closet and escapes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Red holds Adelaide hostage and begins trying to slam her face against the glass table, but the commotion caused by Jason&#39;s escape leads her away. In a panic, Adelaide manages to get the fireplace poker, destroys the leg of the table, and get Jason. They are both reunited with Zora and Gabe, and the Wilsons manage to escape on the boat with Red and Pluto watching them.<br/><br/>At the Tylers, Kitty thinks she sees something outside. Josh pretends that he does see it, only to reveal that he&#39;s just messing with her. The twins then come out of their rooms and talk, and the second they think that everything is alright...a set of doppelgangers wearing red, similar to the Wilsons, all emerge and kill the whole family. When the Wilsons arrive looking for help, Kitty&#39;s double drags Adelaide into the house while Gabe attempts to distract Josh&#39;s double. After a fight, the Wilsons manage to kill all of the Tylers&#39; doppelgangers and reunite inside the house.<br/><br/>The Wilsons turn on the TV and find out from frantic news reports that the red doubles have been inexplicably appearing and killing people all over the world, and have joined together to hold hands (similar to Hands Across America). Gabe wants to take refuge in the house, but Adelaide says they have to keep moving and escape. The family decides to take the Tylers&#39; car, but when Adelaide looks for the key, a still-living Kitty&#39;s doppelganger attacks her. She manages to kill her, but when the family gets to the car, Umbrae appears. After a chase sequence, they manage to kill Umbrae when they speed up and abruptly stop the vehicle, causing her to fly into a tree.<br/><br/>It is now morning, and the Wilsons get to the boardwalk. At the boardwalk, they see their original car burning with Pluto standing in front. Adelaide decides to get out and walk to him... and soon realizes that it&#39;s a trap. Jason acts fast and makes Pluto walk backwards into the burning car, and just as the family thinks it&#39;s over, Red grabs Jason.<br/><br/>Adelaide runs after them, while Zora and Gabe see that the beach is now full of red-faced doppelgangers joining hands. Adelaide makes her way back to the fun-house and goes all the way down into a tunnel with rabbits roaming free. She finds Red inside one of the many rooms, and Red explains her plan. Red says that all this time, the underground (presumably the dimension of Hell) has been filled with everyone&#39;s doppelgangers, and now it is their time to be on the surface. She says that she has always been a part of Adelaide, and when she was a ballet dancer as a kid, it led her out of the tunnels and into the fun-house where they met. It took her a long time, but a plan was made with everyone in the tunnel which was now being executed.<br/><br/>After a fight, Adelaide manages to overpower Red and gets Jason back. The family reunites and drives away. All is good, and everyone looks relieved until a quick flashback shows that when &quot;Red&quot; met Adelaide in the fun-house all those years ago, she knocked her out, took her Thriller T-Shirt, and went off into the real world. The &quot;Adelaide&quot; we&#39;ve been watching for the whole movie is actually the doppelganger, and &quot;Red&quot; was simply the real Adelaide getting her revenge (this also explains why &quot;Red&quot; is the only one of the doubles to have concrete speech while all the other doppelgangers in the film have guttural, animalistic sounds). Jason appears to realize the truth, and puts his mask on uneasily.<br/><br/>The film ends with a zoom out showing all the red doppelgangers around the United States joined together, holding hands (similar to Hands Across America), with news and police helicopters surveying them from above.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')"

Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, warns her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an organic artificial intelligence who acts as the ruler of the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check.<br/><br/>While working with official Ronan the Accuser to rescue an undercover spy, Vers is abducted and subjected to a memory probe by a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree Empire is at war. Vers escapes and, after leaving the Skrulls&#39; ship in an escape pod, crash lands on Earth. Her presence attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her memories and Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Fury later meets and agrees to work with Vers while Skrull commander Talos disguises himself as S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Keller.<br/><br/>Using Fury&#39;s security clearance, Vers learns she was a pilot who is presumed to have died six years earlier while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by scientist Wendy Lawson, who she recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. The two escape after &quot;Keller&quot; confronts them, with Lawson&#39;s cat Goose stowing away, and pilot a small cargo jet to Louisiana. A meeting with felllow pilot Maria Rambeau and her young daughter Monica reveals Vers&#39; real name is Carol Danvers.<br/><br/>Talos, who had tracked her, arrives and asks to speak. Using the black-box recorder of Lawson&#39;s crashed plane, Danvers learns an alien spaceship had shot it down - and she now remembers Yon-Rogg killing Lawson, as well as Lawson&#39;s warning that the experimental engine&#39;s energy-core had to be destroyed to keep it from the wrong hands. Vers shot it and was caught in an ensuing explosion, with her body absorbing the energy. Yon-Rogg brought the amnesiac &quot;Vers&quot; - the remaining portion of &quot;Danvers&quot; on her broken dog tag - to Hala.<br/><br/>Talos explains the Skrulls are simply refugees, and Lawson&#39;s engine was to help them escape beyond Kree reach. Using coordinates Lawson had given Danvers, she, along with Fury, Monica, and Goose - who for some reason terrifies Talos - fly their Skrull-modified cargo jet to a cloaked ship in orbit. There they find the source of the energy-core&#39;s power, the Tesseract - and some Skrull refugees, including Talos&#39; mate and child. Yon-Rogg&#39;s Starforce, having tracked them, captures Danvers and places her in VR before the Supreme Intelligence. Enraged at being used, Danvers fights back, and discovers that a Kree implant that purportedly gave her Kree powers was instead limiting them.<br/><br/>Accessing her full force, Danvers escapes, gives the Tesseract to Fury for safekeeping, and battles the Starforce to give Rambeau time to fly herself, Fury, and the Skrulls to Earth - along with Goose, who is not a cat but an alien known as a Flerken that can sprout powerful tentacles and whose insides are a pocket dimension where the Tesseract is placed. Rambeau shoots down a pursuing Minn-Erva. Danvers chases an escaping Yon-Rogg and discovers the extent of her powers, including flight.

Abby decides to volunteer from time-to-time. Believing Planned Parenthood&#39;s positions, such as &quot;the fetus can&#39;t feel any pain&quot;, Abby slowly becomes a strong supporter of the mission, despite her Mom&#39;s strong anti-abortion position. After volunteering for awhile, Abby decides to take a paid position. Shortly after, the Clinic Director begins to see something extra in Abby. When the time comes to take on one of the hardest tasks in the clinic, Abby surprises the Clinic Director by staying steady when separating and accounting for all of the body parts of an aborted baby. After the Clinic Director receives a promotion, she promotes Abby, making her the youngest ever Planned Parenthood Clinic Director. Abby excels at her job, including pressuring pregnant women to agree quickly to abortion by telling them the cost of their abortion increases the longer they wait. Her passion for the work shows as she keeps the clinic open during an approaching hurricane. Planned Parenthood recognizes her talents with their employee of the year award. Her passion changes after two significant events. First, Planned Parenthood decides they need more profits and doubles the expectations for the number of abortions. Abby points out the conflict with the new emphasis on the quantity of abortions and Planned Parenthood&#39;s stated mission statement. Admonished for &quot;lack of loyalty&quot;, she returns to her clinic. Second, an abortion doctor calls on Abby to assist with following the abortion on an ultrasound. This first-ever experience shakes her to her core when she sees the unborn child fighting to avoid the suction. Abby realizes the baby&#39;s will to live as it fights for his/her life. Now shattered, Abby decides to quit and volunteer to help the anti-abortion group that appears outside of her clinic at times. Not the end of the story. Planned Parenthood decides to attack her in court. Her attorney shows the suit as clearly groundless in the hearing. Ultimately, Planned Parenthood closes the clinic.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')"

She meets another CF patient, Will Newman (Cole Sprouse), and they quickly develop feelings for each other. Will finds Stella&#39;s Vlog on YouTube, in which Stella discusses living with CF. Will is intrigued and watches every single video she posted.<br/><br/>Stella&#39;s best friend, Poe, also has CF and is openly gay. He tells Stella that he broke up with his new boyfriend; Stelle later realizes Poe was pushing away because of his CF. Stella&#39;s sister, Abby, was the adventurous type and died a few years ago while she was cliff diving.<br/><br/>CF patients are strictly kept at least six feet (1.8 m) apart to reduce the risk of cross-infection, as contracting bacterial infections from other CF patients can be life-threatening. Stella&#39;s nurse, Barbara, previously had a pair of romantically involved CF patients who died from cross-infection, and Barbara does not want to see this happen again.<br/><br/>Will and Stella go on their first date but keep it secret, as the nurses wouldn&#39;t approve. During the date, they make sure to stay six feet apart. They eventually end up at the hospital pool, where they strip to reveal their scars from their past surgeries. They stare at each other and go for a swim together. Halfway through their date, Barbara notices that both Will and Stella aren&#39;t in their rooms. She immediately goes on a search to find them. They are aware of this, and quickly make it back to their rooms in time.<br/><br/>Will is at the hospital for a medication trial, which is trying to get rid of the bacterial infection he had in his lungs. Stella notices that Will isn&#39;t strictly adhering to his treatment and she offers to let him draw her, in exchange for Will following his treatment regimen. Much of their interaction is mediated through video chat, and they arrange a second date.<br/><br/>Stella&#39;s resolve to follow the six foot rule weakens, and she agrees to a second date with will, policed by a five-foot billiards cue. They walk around the hospital while holding opposite ends of the pool cue, falling further in love. Stella comes up with a scavenger hunt for Will&#39;s birthday, which catches him by surprise. It leads to Will meeting up with Stella, who leads him to a room filled with all of her and his friends. They have a huge feast that was made by Poe and shared a ton of laughs.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the nurses are catching on to Will&#39;s and Stella&#39;s relationship, and make the decision to transfer Will to another hospital in hopes of protecting both of them. As they are about to submit the transfer note, they got an alert from Poe&#39;s room. The nurses rush in to find him out cold on his hospital room&#39;s floor. A few more nurses enter the room; one gives CPR in hope that Poe will survive, but he never wakes up. Stella and Will are quick to find out what happened. Stella is in tears: Poe was her best friend and she never got to hug him.<br/><br/>Stella then realizes that she is living life too strictly. She lets Will know that growing up, everyone was prepared for her to die, but she has been the only one to live. She said that after Abby&#39;s death, her parents death, and Poe&#39;s death, she has survivor guilt. She also tells him that it was her dream to see the lights, but it would require them to walk two miles (3.2 km) away from the hospital in the snow.<br/><br/>As Will and Stella go to see the lights, Stella grabs Will&#39;s hand, which she justifies because she has gloves on. They come across a pond and slide around on the frozen surface. Meanwhile, the hospital is notified that after years of waiting, a lung transplant is available for Stella. She receives a bunch of texts asking where she is, but she ignores them to be with Will.<br/><br/>Stella sits of a bridge, but then falls off while Will is distracted. She fell through the ice and Will pulls her out of the water. The shock of the cold water has made Stella unresponsive and put her into cardiac arrest. Ignoring the risk of infection, Will performs CPR and Stella wakes up. They make their way back to the hospital and Stella learns that she didn&#39;t catch the infection from Will.<br/><br/>When Stella wakes up from her surgery, she sees Will through the glass of her room. He tells her that he only has a month to live, and he doesn&#39;t want her to have to go through his death like all the other deaths she went through. He tells her goodbye and doesn&#39;t know what is to come in terms of him and her. Before he goes, he makes her close her eyes, because he said he wouldn&#39;t be able to leave if she was looking at him. She closes her eyes and he walks away.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')"

The gang consists of Boomer, a big blue bear that greets patrons; Greta, a boar who manages and keeps things under control; Gus and Cooper, beaver brothers; Steve, a porcupine who is in love with Greta; and the park&#39;s mascot/leader Peanut, a monkey who hears Mrs. Bailey&#39;s voice and is given the inspiration to create with his magic marker.<br/><br/>As June gets older, her imagination grows. She and her friend Banky create a contraption that functions like a theme park ride, but it goes out of control and causes massive damage to the town. June&#39;s parents scold her, but her mom tells her she can keep her imagination going as long as it doesn&#39;t destroy the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Over time, the family continues to have fun, but Mrs. Bailey starts to get sick. She is sent away for recovery, leaving June scared and depressed. She starts to become cynical and refuses to play with the other kids because she thinks they only care about her giving them Wonderland. June and her father are then visited by Uncle Tony and Aunt Albertine. They try to cheer June up by sparking her imagination with talk of Wonderland, but June snaps and throws out the map of Wonderland into the fire before running to her room to cry.<br/><br/>Mr. Bailey gets ready to send June to math camp with Banky and their other friends. Barely ten minutes into the bus ride, June becomes paranoid that her father will not be able to handle himself without her, so she uses Banky to create a distraction on the bus and get them to pull over. June uses the opportunity to run back home through the woods. She then finds a burnt piece of the Wonderland map flying toward it. June chases after it as it takes her deeper into the woods, and she finds herself in a completely different place. She steps inside a rocket ride and is transported into Wonderland before her very eyes...or at least, what used to be Wonderland.<br/><br/>When June gets down to the park, she finds the animals all fleeing in terror from a dark storm cloud. Emerging from it are Chimpanzombies, formerly the park&#39;s Wonder Chimps now becoming terrible troublemakers. The animals run and evade the Chimpanzombies. June introduces herself and tells the animals that she and her mom are responsible for creating them. Greta seems to be suspicious of June being there, but she proves what she knows about them due to naming a very specific way that Steve drinks his tea. June asks them what happened to Peanut, and they tell her that he went off on his own to reactivate Clockwork Springs to bring the park back to life, but he was captured by the Chimpanzombies.<br/><br/>June leads the animals to Clockwork Springs to help fix it, but she doesn&#39;t seem to know what she is supposed to do. The Chimpanzombies then attack once again in a giant robot that wreaks more havoc across the park. In the chaos, June gets separated from the animals and finds herself in Zero Gravity Land. There, she finds Peanut hiding in a room he created to escape the darkness. He feels lost without hearing the voice in his head and he chooses to stay alone so that he can&#39;t get hurt. This leads June to realize that the darkness was created by herself as a result of her cynicism from her mom&#39;s sickness. The Chimpanzombies then show up and attack once again and take Peanut as their prisoner, but June manages to escape with Peanut&#39;s marker.<br/><br/>June runs back to the animals to tell them that she found Peanut and his marker, but also confesses that she is responsible for the darkness. The animals are all upset, but Greta is especially displeased. They abandon June and leave her alone and helpless. After taking a moment, June gathers the courage inside her to reactivate her imagination and get a robot up and running to join the animals to help them. As they come up with a plan to stop the Chimpanzombies, they put Boomer on top of a roller coaster. His car gets pushed over by a bird, leading him to roll down the roller coaster without safety. The other animals manage to get him to come to a stop.<br/><br/>The gang finds the Chimpanzombies taking Peanut to get sucked up into the darkness. The animals fight back while June rushes to save Peanut. She jumps up into the void and reaches Peanut. She convinces him that she will provide the voice for his imagination and that he cannot let the darkness take him over. June gives Peanut an idea for making a slide to get them out of there. As they slide down, June then notices Clockwork Springs is her name written in cursive, just like on the piece of her map. With Peanut&#39;s help, they get Clockwork Springs back up and running, which gets rid of the darkness, brings Wonderland back to life, and makes the Chimpanzombies turn back into regular Wonder Chimps. Children then start coming back with their families and are in awe of the animals. The animals welcome Peanut back as their leader, but he says that Greta did a good job leading them. They look up to the sky and see the cloud is still there, which June interprets as meaning that while the darkness may never really go away, it is there to remind us to look on the bright side. June says farewell to her animal friends before returning to the real world.<br/><br/>June runs out of the woods and goes back home to her father, now with more spirit and vigor than before. She and Banky then get together to create more things to make a real Wonderland. There is then another knock at the door, and Mr. Bailey tells June she should get the door. He opens it, and Mrs. Bailey comes inside, now feeling all better. June jumps into her mother&#39;s arms.<br/><br/>The Baileys then unveil the real Wonderland in their backyard, which is big enough to have all the neighborhood kids show up. June starts to tell the kids a story about Wonderland, and she takes a doll of Peanut and whispers an idea into his ear. In Wonderland, Peanut hears the idea, and he takes his magic marker to make the idea come to life.</li>\n    </ul>', ' ')"

Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) and Toothless infiltrate it to rescue captured dragons, with Hiccup wearing a suit of dragon scales to walk through fire. They are joined by Astrid (voice of America Ferrera), Snotlout (voice of Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (voice of Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut (voice of Kristen Wiig) and Tuffnut (voice of Justin Rupple), all wearing scale suits and riding in on their dragons to fight the trappers. The heroes free the dragons and escape, unaware that they have left one behind.<br/><br/>The Dragon Riders return to Berk, which is now wildly overpopulated with dragons that they have rescued over the last year, with one new dragon knocking over a whole row of dragon towers. Hiccup has been leading the villagers as chief, but he still doesn&#39;t feel that he is the chief his father was. Meanwhile, Valka (voice of Cate Blanchett) has been helping train other dragons. Gobber (voice of Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup and Astrid should get married soon, but neither of them feel they are ready in their relationship to take that step.<br/><br/>A notorious dragon slayer called Grimmel the Grisly (voice of F. Murray Abraham) arrives to meet with the warlords that have been capturing dragons. When they tell Grimmel about Hiccup and Toothless, he finds himself surprised, as he had believed to have slayed every last Night Fury. The warlords show Grimmel the dragon that was left behind, a white Night Fury (&quot;Light Fury&quot; as it will later be known). He decides to use her as bait to lure Toothless to him, and he doesn&#39;t worry about Hiccup since Grimmel sees him as just a boy in over his head.<br/><br/>We see a flashback of a young Hiccup with Stoick (voice of Gerard Butler), who tells his son about the legend of a hidden world of dragons. He had hoped to find it so that he can end the fighting between vikings and dragons.<br/><br/>Toothless goes out alone at night and comes across the Light Fury. He becomes enamored by her and starts making an attempt to woo her. Hiccup and Astrid come across them, but they startle her and she fires a blast in their direction before she vanishes into thin air.<br/><br/>Toothless falls in love with the Light Fury, which Hiccup can see. He takes Toothless and Tuffnut (who wants to give Hiccup relationship advice) back into the woods to look for her, but Hiccup manages to detect one of Grimmel&#39;s traps before it catches Toothless. He brings back a tranquilizer dart they found, which Eret (voice of Kit Harington) recognizes as Grimmel&#39;s work. He warns Hiccup that Grimmel most likely wanted them to find that trap as a means to lead him right back to them.<br/><br/>That night, Hiccup finds Grimmel has snuck inside his house and seemingly tranquilized Toothless. He orders Hiccup to give Toothless up and expresses how he thinks humans and dragons shouldn&#39;t co-exist since he views humans as being superior. When he goes to Toothless, it turns out that he shot Fishlegs, and Hiccup&#39;s friends and family come out to ambush Grimmel. However, he summons his acid-spitting Deathgrippers to tear through Hiccup&#39;s home. He gathers the Berkians together and realizes that with Grimmel going after them, it is no longer safe to stay in that land. While some of the villagers argue against leaving their homes, Hiccup tells them that they are Berk no matter where they live. However, Grimmel was counting on them to abandon their homes all along, and he plans to keep tracking Toothless with reluctant help from the warlords. all while making more of the venom to tranquilize dragons.<br/><br/>The Berkians travel with the dragons to another island to stay temporarily. The Light Fury appears to follow the group, but she vanishes after knocking Hiccup off of Toothless&#39;s back after mistaking him for an enemy. She reappears later that night, and Toothless goes after her. Hiccup wakes up and goes to try and help him out. Toothless does goofy dances to court the Light Fury, which does not impress her. He then manages to draw her face in the sand, which she seems to like. Unfortunately, she flies away again when she spots Hiccup, and Toothless is unable to fly after her because of his bad fin. Hiccup later decides to fix up the fin and paint it black so that Toothless can go and find the Light Fury.<br/><br/>Valka heads back out on Cloudjumper to make sure the villagers weren&#39;t followed. They are spotted by the Deathgrippers, who try to attack and bring them down, but the two manage to escape and head back to warn Hiccup.<br/><br/>Toothless flies until he finds the Light Fury. They take flight together as she demonstrates her ability to camouflage herself using her fire breath. With her help, Toothless is able to use his own power with lightning to achieve the same effect. They continue flying until the Light Fury brings Toothless to a waterfall.<br/><br/>After learning Grimmel is hot on their trail, Hiccup leads the Dragon Riders to catch him, but he was expecting this, so they have fallen into his trap. He sends the Deathgrippers after them, but they manage to evade them and escape. They accidentally leave Ruffnut behind and don&#39;t realize it until they return to the island. Hiccup is then pressured into finding another solution to stopping Grimmel. He notices Toothless hasn&#39;t returned, and Astrid reminds him that he gave Toothless his freedom to be with the Light Fury.<br/><br/>As Grimmel tries to make his next move, Ruffnut starts to annoy the hell out of him with her endless talking, so he frees her. Ruffnut inadvertently blabs about their new location, so he keeps a close eye on her to see where she&#39;s headed.<br/><br/>Hiccup and Astrid ride Stormfly to find Toothless. They come across the waterfall and are flown down into the hidden dragon world, which is vast and beautiful. They see Hiccup acting as the alpha to all the dragons (you can even see Drago&#39;s Bewilderbeest among them), with the Light Fury now officially being his mate. The other dragons spot Hiccup and Astrid and chase after them. Toothless and Stormfly grab them and flee. Hiccup starts to figure that the Berkians couldn&#39;t live with the dragons in their world and that maybe that&#39;s where the dragons ought to be.<br/><br/>Ruffnut returns to the village, and Grimmel has followed her back. He and his men, plus the Deathgrippers, start to attack again, this time ending with Grimmel successfully capturing Toothless and the Light Fury. The other dragons are forced to follow Grimmel since he has their alpha, and he threatens to kill the Light Fury if Hiccup follows. Hiccup feels hopeless and sees himself as a failure as chief. Astrid encourages him as she always has, letting him know she was the first person to believe in him and will always be there to pick him up. Hiccup rounds up his friends with their dragon suits to fly after the ship.<br/><br/>Grimmel brings his captured dragons to the warlords, but he tells them that he plans to kill Toothless for himself, denying them the chance to have him for themselves. The heroes then swoop in to free their dragons and take on Grimmel&#39;s army. They manage to steer the dragon trapper ships toward each other, causing the trappers to abandon ship as they all sink. Grimmel attempts to kill Hiccup, but he manages to free Toothless. Grimmel takes the Light Fury to the sky, leading Hiccup and Toothless to chase after them. The Deathgrippers fly in and surround Toothless, until he harnesses his lightning power and electrocutes them all before vanishing. He appears before Grimmel, and Hiccup jumps toward him. Grimmel tranquilizes Toothless, sending him falling to the ground. Hiccup tackles the villain and frees the Light Fury, order her to save Toothless as Hiccup and Grimmel fall. The Light Fury catches Toothless and lands with him on a cliff. Grimmel tears Hiccup&#39;s suit apart, but the Light Fury flies toward Hiccup. He loosens his prosthetic foot, sending Grimmel to his watery grave as the Light Fury catches Hiccup.<br/><br/>The Berkians celebrate their victory until Hiccup realizes it is time to let Toothless go. He bids his best friend farewell, and the two embrace tearfully. The other Berkians must then say goodbye to their beloved dragons. They fly toward the hidden world, with Toothless sharing one last look with Hiccup.<br/><br/>A while later, Hiccup and Astrid get married, making them chief and chieftess. We then cut to years later where Hiccup and Astrid now have a son and a daughter. They ride a boat toward the hidden world and come across Toothless and the Light Fury sitting together on a rock with three little dragons of their own. Toothless flies over to the boat and does not seem to immediately recognize Hiccup. He slowly moves his hand toward his snout as he did when they first met, and Toothless pounces on Hiccup for the first time in perhaps a decade. Astrid then brings the kids over so that Hiccup can introduce them to Toothless. They then take flight on Toothless, Stormfly, and the Light Fury together as a family.
